# ================================
#
# Purpose:
# This file is part of a GitHub Actions workflow named "Check Broken Links". It contains a list of URLs or links that
# are intended to be skipped during the automated link-checking process.
#
# Instructions:
# - Add the links that should be skipped by the "Check Broken Links" workflow to this file.
# - Each link should be on a new line.
# - Clearly document the reason for skipping each link.
# - Avoid using this file to bypass issues that can be resolved by correcting or updating the link.
#
# The workflow runs a job named "linkcheck" on a schedule and manually (workflow_dispatch). If the job fails,
# it uploads the results as an artifact and creates a GitHub issue notifying of the broken links found.
#
# Format:
# <URL> # Reason for skipping
#
# Example:
# http://example-broken-link.com # Broken link, site is down
