## My Birth Story

## The First Month Post-Birth

The first week after our baby boy was born, G and I spent high as kites and intensely in love. When I asked G if he had regrets, he told me that he regretted not having Dylan earlier; it was the same for me. Then, in the second week, I developed breast inflammation, which came with a fever and chills. By the time I recovered, it was week three, and both G and I went down badly. I remember a very dark moment on the couch, holding each other, asking ourselves, “What have we done?” Then, as our highs and lows stabilized, we slowly started getting back to our life and favorite things but now *with* Dylan.

## Favorites

I made an effort not to get drawn out by the relentless new-parent marketing attacks and to keep maternity and baby shopping down to a minimum. It helped that we didn’t arrive in our nest until I was 37 weeks pregnant and restricted family and friends from buying us things. Also, I was pretty fortunate with the purchases that I did make, which almost all became the favorites you’ll find below.

Since G and I didn’t know how long we’d stay in Amsterdam after I’d give birth, we decided to rent a co-sleeper ([Co-sleeper Chicco Next2Me Magic](https://tinylibrary.nl/products/co-sleeper-chicco-next2me-magic)) and stroller ([Babyzen Yoyo](https://tinylibrary.nl/collections/onderweg/products/kinderwagen-babyzen-yoyo)).
