Hi All!

**How are you?** 🍃

Since last month, I’ve been taking my walks and slow weekends more seriously than ever.

I’m also reading more books about meditation and being.

A few days ago, when I was stressed, I tried detaching from that feeling, following an instruction from the book [Awareness](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385249373).

Instead of saying, “I’m stressed,” I said, “There’s stress.”

As I kept returning to this phrase, the rush in my stomach weakened. And then, a different thought dropped in, “But there’s also peace.”

I laughed and cried while I continued, “There’s stress, but there’s also peace..”

There’s fear, but there’s also curiosity. There’s shame, and surrender. There’s worry, but there’s also gratefulness. There’s “I’m not enough,” and there’s _being_.

All these experiences exist at the same time in the same space. That day, I decided to follow the peace.

Later, however, I also realized that once I become aware of the shore, I can decide to dwell in the deep, let it show me what it has to offer, maybe even to teach, but without drowning me.

## Code

🗺 I’m currently working on [Wagon City Guides](https://wagon-city-guides.herokuapp.com/), a city guide app for Le Wagon’s campuses (the coding bootcamp where I learned to code).

I went into production beginning October and shared the project with Wagon’s teacher’s community (about 1000+ people). The response was very positive, and I’m hoping other developers will start contributing too.

The project is part of my [web dev MBA curriculum](/posts/leap-of-code/#curriculum) about which you can read more in my post [Leap of Code](/posts/leap-of-code).

## Words

☕️ [Slow Coffee](/posts/slow-coffee)

> My parent’s coffee ritual has always been strong, and their a.m. game sacred. In my mind’s eye, I can see them sitting on the balcony or in the garden, or in their living room, around a pinewood table piece with a glass top. The X from where my memories of home originate, and not unlike Madrid’s Kilometre Zero from which the distances of Spain’s national roads are measured, this coffee table seems to mark the start of my paths.

I never thought I’d write a post about coffee. But then again, I never thought I’d write a post about [skincare](/posts/korean-skin-care-routine/) either. And I did both.

This story is about how coffee became part of my daily ritual. I also added a list of my favorite beans, gear, and a bit more.

## A Poem I’m Pondering

🔖 “Out Beyond” by Rumi

> Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,\
> there is a field. I’ll meet you there.\
> When the soul lies down in that grass,\
> the world is too full to talk about.\
> Ideas, language, even the phrase *each other*doesn’t make sense.

Waiting for you far in,\
With an extra pair of floaties,\
And so much love,\
Mirha\
🌊
