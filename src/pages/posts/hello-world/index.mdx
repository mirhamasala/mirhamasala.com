In pursuit of finding out what I want to do for a living, I experimented with 12 different lifestyles in the last five years.

I tried being a polyglot, artist, kiteboarder, philanthropist, dancer, entrepreneur, reader, snowboarder, traveler, meditator, surfer and photographer.

In the process, and while documenting my experiences at [thespinoffproject.com](/tsop), I developed my fondness for extreme sports and 30-day challenges and discovered that I have an itch for creating, writing, and .. working with code.

Of all the lifestyles I tried, it was the ones that I half-led in the background that I now look forward to focusing on for the next five years of my life.

I’m starting my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer while I hope to use these pages here for experiments, creative collaborations, and some musings on life and travel.
