When I was younger, I was desperate for _some_ independence. I revolted against my world, my parents; I roared for space.

But my parents, unable to trust me with what I needed, instead, did what they had been taught and tightened the reins even more.

I moved out when I was 18. The distance helped. I had more physical freedom. Our relationship improved. But the balance of control was still off.

It kept being off. And this year, push came to shove. I force-claimed a breather.

It was hard. And confusing.

I had never come this far. And I didn’t know they were capable of staying away.

> Parents rarely let go of their children, so children let go of them. They move on. They move away. . . . It is not until much later, as the skin sags, and the heart weakens, that children understand; their stories, and all their accomplishments, sit atop the stories of their mothers and fathers, stones upon stones, beneath the water of their lives. –Mitch Albom, [The Five People You Meet in Heaven](http://a.co/aa2NQ4v)

While I figured out what to do with the space that was finally given to me, the space between us filled itself.

I kept thinking about the road trips we used to do. The places they had taken me to.

And I realized something that I never thought about before: that I get my love for travel and food from them.

More precisely, it’s because of my parents that I not only like road trips, but also the hunt for those restaurants along the way that specialize in that one dish.

Those pit stops that are worth a road trip alone.

I came across a few of those places on my trips to California. And if my parents had been American, I’m sure they would’ve known about them, taken me there.

We would stop here.

[The Girl With The Blueprint](http://www.thegirlwiththeblueprint.com), a city guide that I set up a few years ago, is based on this idea of going to a place for that one dish or drink it does best in town. I remember some people thinking that was such a weird criteria. One guy asked me, “But what if I don’t like soup?”

Unexpectedly, I now live in Singapore where it’s normal for restaurants to focus their attention on a single dish. In the two years that I’ve been living here, I’ve never heard anyone say: “Oh, everything is good on this menu.”
