Hi, All!

**How are you?**Â  ðŸ¤©

I was on a coding cloud, infatuated with my new career as a web developer. For weeks, I would wake up at 06:00, sneak out of bed, and start coding until my eyes turned square, twelve hours later.

After finishing my first freelance project a couple of weeks ago, the fatigue kicked in, and so did the blues. I felt slightly sad in the way that one may feel the day after completing a race.

Thus, Iâ€™ve been taking it easy this week. Trying to be patient and allowing myself to return to my emotional baseline.

From here on, thereâ€™ll be no more sprinting toward mastery. Iâ€™ve realized now, learning to code is marathon material.

## Words

To balance all this code talk, Iâ€™ve some news from my alter ego, the blogger. Thereâ€™s a new post up on mirhamasala.com

As promised, itâ€™s about [The 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine](/posts/korean-skin-care-routine/). Hereâ€™s how it starts:

> With a solid layer of dirt on my face and between my toes, I walked into my hostel dorm. When straight away, in the far right corner, I saw a big yellow tube on the sink. From up close it read â€˜cleansing volcano something.â€™ I took the cleansing part as a sign, and then, I took a dollop.

In this post, youâ€™ll also find all the skincare products that I use and some advice on how to get your routine going.

## Meet Me

Iâ€™ve got a few trips coming up to Tel Aviv, Amsterdam, Madrid, and Sarajevo. If you happen to live in any of these places, please do let me know. I would love to meet you for a coffee.

## Cheeky Fact

June 11 marks seven years since Mr. G and I sealed our friendship with a big, fat french kiss.

## Advice Iâ€™m Pondering

Nobody tells people who are beginners â€” and I really wish somebody had told this to me â€” is that all of us who do creative work â€¦ we get into it because we have good taste. But itâ€™s like thereâ€™s a gap, that for the first couple years that youâ€™re making stuff, what youâ€™re making isnâ€™t so good, okay? Itâ€™s not that great. Itâ€™s really not that great. Itâ€™s _trying_ to be good, it has ambition to be good, but itâ€™s not quite that good. But your _taste_ â€” the thing that got you into the game â€” your taste is still killer, and your taste is good enough that you can tell that what youâ€™re making is kind of a disappointment to you, you know what I mean?

A lot of people never get past that phase. A lot of people at that point, they quit. And the thing I would just like say to you with all my heart is that most everybody I know who does interesting creative work, they went through a phase of _years_ where they had really good taste and they could tell what they were making wasnâ€™t as good as they wanted it to be â€” they knew it fell short, it didnâ€™t have the special thing that we wanted it to have.

And the thing I would say to you is _everybody_ goes through that. And for you to go through it, if youâ€™re going through it right now, if youâ€™re just getting out of that phase â€” you gotta know itâ€™s totally normal.

And the most important possible thing you can do is do a lot of work â€” do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week, or every month, you know youâ€™re going to finish one story. Because itâ€™s only by actually going through a volume of work that you are actually going to catch up and close that gap. And the work youâ€™re making will be as good as your ambitions. It takes a while, itâ€™s gonna take _you_ a while â€” itâ€™s normal to take a while. And you just have to _fight your way through that,_ okay?
