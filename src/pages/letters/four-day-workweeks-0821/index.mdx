Hey all!

**How are you doing?** 🍃

I filled life in July with long walks along the river, mini yoga and meditations sessions, stints of writing, reading, and buckets of quality time with my parents.

I also worked only four days a week and will continue to do so in August. It’s during these two summer months that my company decided to give us the Fridays off.

The balance that four days of work and three days of rest brings has been a gift. A magic formula that allows life to slow down and for time to pass at a much more agreeable pace.

With the focus a touch less on hustle, achievement, and making money, a gap for rest, the pursuit of hobbies, and precious moments with loved ones opened. Even those pesky house chores that drag seem to be done with more ease. And I wallow without guilt hours at a stretch, lost in faraway stories.

Just as the last evenings of school holidays, the thought of our summer arrangement ending, delivers a familiar ache in my stomach, and I close my eyes, wishing, praying, that the four-day workweek was here to stay.

## Birthday Wish

It’s that time again! The time when I get to ask you to share your dreams and fears with me. So write me back and let me know: What are you grateful for? What made you angry lately? Proud of yourself? Disappointed? What do you wish? Fear? What are you taking with you in the months to come? What will you leave behind?

## Tiny Update

For G’s and my tenth anniversary, I asked Jarom Vogel to create an illustration to go with [Like Love Exploding](/posts/like-love-exploding/).

## Current Favorites

🍋 [Lemongrass Solid Conditioner Bar](https://www.rawcarestudio.com/collections/hair-care/products/lemongrass-solid-hair-mask) by Raw Care Studio\
Here’s the message I sent founder Mili after I tried Raw Care’s conditioner bar:\
\
“I just washed my hair. 😱 What’s in that conditioner!? With my hair being curly, it’s a nightmare to comb through. But after folding my hair into the bar, it was such a smooth affair. And once my curls dried, they even looked defined. I was already in love with the shampoo _(talking about the [Almond & Moroccan Clay Solid Shampoo](https://www.rawcarestudio.com/collections/hair-care/products/almond-moroccan-clay-solid-shampoo))_, but the conditioner is next level and my new favorite. Plus, it’s natural!?”\
\
I also adore the [Holy Body Butter – Palo Santo, Vanilla & Sandalwood](https://www.rawcarestudio.com/collections/body-care/products/holy-body-butter-with-palo-santo-sandalwood-vanilla) (and so do mom and dad).

🥩 [Ancestral Supplements](https://ancestralsupplements.com/)\
G and I have been following a primarily animal-based diet for over a year, which translates to eating fish, seafood, meat, organs, eggs, cheese, and some fruits and honey. Although it’s common to see dishes with organs on the menu in Sarajevo, and my mom used to cook them too, they aren’t something G and I have had regularly. While we learn to eat organs again, it’s been great to increase our intake with Ancestral Supplements.

🔥 **Palo Santo Sticks**\
Ever since I remember, I’ve loved burning incense and candles (so much so that I burned down my student room once). I’m now getting back into that ritual mode with Palo Santo while working on getting G to embrace the scent too.

☕️ [Stagg EKG Electric Kettle](https://fellowproducts.com/products/staggekg)\
The Stagg kettle is stunning and comes with a super precise pouring spout, plus a hold mode for maintaining temperature. It makes brewing coffee a meditative breeze and something I look forward to in the morning.

🍃 [Zamioculcas – Emerald Palm](https://royalgreen.nl/assortiment/zamioculcas-emerald-palm/)\
In May this year, I bought my first plant. It was love at first sight, and a love sealed when the flower lady told me that she almost doesn’t need any watering. [Silvia](https://silviafalcomer.com/about) suggested I name her, and so I called her Zanzi Kan in honor of her godmother [Devon Kan](https://www.cafebirke.com/about) who inspired me to get a plant in the first place.

🎵 **Lyrics On My Mind**

> Slow down, you’re doin’ fine\
> You can’t be everything you wanna be before your time\
> Slow down, you crazy child\
> And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile\
> It’s alright, you can afford to lose a day or two\
> – Billy Joel, [Vienna](https://open.spotify.com/track/4U45aEWtQhrm8A5mxPaFZ7)

With love,\
