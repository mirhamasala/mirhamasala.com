**Hi All!**

**How are you? ♥️**

A few weeks ago, I found myself in possession of a self-inflicted, never-ending to-do list that demanded to be crossed off.

I always seem to end up with one of these when I get back from traveling. It stresses the hell out of me, and before I know it, my mind is screaming to get back to quiet.

As soon as I realized what was happening, I upped my meditation practice and started doing sun salutations when I woke up.

I also got Eckhart Tolle’s [_Now_](http://a.co/d/5JubIzb) on Audible and began to focus my attention on being and creating rather than managing my future and worries.

Finally, I split my to-do list in “to-dos” and “would be nice to do to-dos,” and copied/pasted the latter on a different piece of electronic paper and out of daily sight.

I’m okay, now.

## Code

I’ve officially started working on real projects. The first couple of weeks were maddening as I tried to find my way around and to be of some use too. I finally seem to have managed to do a bit of both just this last week. One of the features that I was asked to build was a “[progress tracker](https://codepen.io/mirhamasala/pen/QVKaxG).”

## Experiments

Recently I got myself into Marie Kondo’s _Life-Changing Magic of Tidying_. I went as far as I could and am loving it. I’ve swept through the entire house and kept only the things that bring me joy. My home feels far more peaceful and pleasant now. And I feel calmer and more inspired. It’s like there’s more space to be and create. I also learned to properly fold things, which is oddly enough quite fun to do. I listened to both of Kondo’s books (_[Life-Changing Magic of Tidying](http://a.co/d/iCumHyF)_ + _[Spark Joy](http://a.co/d/gA1Hunr)_) and can recommend both.

## Words

Aida (my cousin) and I have started translating the letters that our families wrote to each other during the war. I’ve published three of these letters with an intro of my own: [From War with Love](/posts/from-war-with-love).

Sending you much love,\
Mirha\
