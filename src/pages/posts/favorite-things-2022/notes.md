With [The Knitting Club](https://www.mirhamasala.com/the-knitting-club), I confronted my [fear of doing nothing](https://www.mirhamasala.com/the-fear-list), and we discussed minimalism and personal finance.

I counted 2 React projects, 9 paper planes, and 25 finished books, 10000 kilometers of road-tripping.

In 2023,

I'm diving into the mundane.

And not taking on more than 3 big projects at once.

I also liked watching the documentary [Playing With Fire](https://www.playingwithfire.co/the-documentary), which helped me recommit to my version of frugal living.

When Dylan was born in March, I also opened a [DEGIRO](https://www.degiro.com/) account for Dylan, to which G and I [invested 3000 EUR](https://paulmerriman.com/how-time-can-turn-3000-into-50-million/). We also decided to move all the cash he gets from family into his account and plan to keep investing an annual sum for him ourselves.

**Plus, a couple more saving challenges:** This year, I also committed to asking for discounts and negotiating prices. And, I stopped buying expensive toiletries and household products.
