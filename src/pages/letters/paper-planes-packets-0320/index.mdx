Hi, All!

**How are you doing?** ðŸŒˆ

Iâ€™m sitting by the bank now, doing pretty fine.

But before this, there was the rush.

It always happens like this.

I stop eating my frogs first thing in the morning. And I let my mind hoax me into what-else and what-more.

I add one more to-do to the list. And then another. I start to read three books at the same time, then four. I take up a new project or two and toss in a few dinners too many and a spring cleaningâ€“why not.

I tell myself Iâ€™m in control until itâ€™s indisputable that Iâ€™m not.

This time around, my body complained first, but I let it slide, and like that, set the recovery of my knee injury back with days.

And since that wasnâ€™t enough of a cry to pull me out, my mind followed with a minor meltdown.

At last, I found myself spat out on the side, left to trace the domino that had pushed me into the tide.

It took a phone call with a friend to catch my breath. And another day to recognize the tile for what it was.

Self-sabotage.

For when things go well, and Iâ€™m making my deadlines and striking that list, I like to decide last minute that what I _really_ need is to stall.

But Iâ€™m learning to catch myself sooner. Dry up a bit quicker. And pick up the pieces that are still left standing. Even if I fall.
