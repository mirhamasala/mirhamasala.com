For 2018, I decided to write a letter a month in an attempt to keep in touch with my friends and readers.

No matter how busy life got, and even if I couldn’t make the time to write a new post, I never failed to send a letter.

I fell in love with the habit and the joy of reading everyone’s thoughtful replies, and so I kept with it.

Below you’ll find the letters that I have sent out so far. The ones marked with a star (⭐️) include my _current favorites_, which could be songs, books, products, lifestyle experiments, or anything else that I’m currently enjoying.

**📬 If you’d like to receive my letters (the first weekend of every month), please drop your e-mail address here: [Paper Planes & Packets](http://eepurl.com/c6iLqr), and I’ll take care of the rest.**
