Pretty much the only cake we make once in a while.[^1] An operation made plenty sweeter now that Dylan mashes the bananas.

## Ingredients

- 60 ml coconut oil, molten
- 80 ml honey (or less)
- 4 large eggs
- 3 medium bananas, very ripe, mashed (plus one extra for garnish, sliced in half)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon vanilla powder (or extract)
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 200 grams almond flour, extra fine (plus extra to flour the pan)

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 165 degrees Celsius. Grease a loaf pan with coconut oil, and flour it with almond flour.

2. In a large bowl, combine the oil and honey. Whisk until blended. Add the eggs, and whisk again until the mixture is combined.

3. Add the mashed bananas, baking powder, vanilla, and baking soda, and stir to combine.

4. Now, add the almond flour and stir again.

5. Pour the batter into the loaf pan. Top with the two banana halves, then brush the tops with coconut oil.

6. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the center of the loaf is springy to the touch and a toothpick comes out clean.

7. Let the pan cool for 30 minutes. Then, use a rubber spatula to loosen the edges of the bread from the pan, and carefully tip it over to release.
