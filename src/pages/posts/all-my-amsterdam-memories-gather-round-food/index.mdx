When I think of Amsterdam, I recall racing G through the night by bike following a date at speakeasy [Door 74](/posts/all-my-amsterdam-memories-gather-round-food#door-74), spotting Carly in the crowd just in time for one of our bottomless gin tonics at Wolvenstraat[^1] and a weekend of hotspot hunting with Arjen for my city guide.

The _lamb roti_, always shared with friends from my velvety white couch, with tender chunks of meat and an Indian-style gravy from takeaway restaurant Usama, a few doors down from my house, also comes to mind. So does the BLT[^2] from Caffe Esprit, discovered on lecture breaks with Rosanne and Carly, which I'd recreate for overnight guests for years to comeâ€“a sarnie recipe so tasty, an ex-boyfriend couldn't resist asking for it inappropriately short after our horrible breakup.

Then there was the late morning with my roommate Stef at [Winkel 43](/posts/all-my-amsterdam-memories-gather-round-food#winkel-43), where he introduced me to the apple pie that beat all other pies in a single bite of the crust. The first time I tried _Maldon Salt_ (with crusty carbs and olive oil at Restaurant Fifteen, where I used to work for a while.) And long afternoons of craft beer tastings on sunlit terraces, like that of [Brouwerij 't IJ](/posts/all-my-amsterdam-memories-gather-round-food#brouwerij-t-ij), or at brown cafes like [De Brabrantse Aap](/posts/all-my-amsterdam-memories-gather-round-food#de-brabantse-aap).

Plus, in my mind's eye, the red vinyl tablecloth with a strawberry print from my student home's shared kitchen table emerges in panorama, where I huddled with friends over Bosnian stuffed peppers smothered with crÃ¨me fraÃ®che and _stamppot_[^3] with a twist: including crunchy salty bacon bits, soft goat cheese, and oval slivers of red chili peppers. And, oh yeah, that one smoked-out dinner because a towel caught fire in a room down the hall.[^4]

I also recall a few phases. Like a pizza phase (more or less just a Fuoco Vivo phase), a hunt for the best burger, a [specialty coffee](/posts/all-my-amsterdam-memories-gather-round-food#coffee) immersion, a sushi expedition, and a long-lasting sandwich phase. The latter includes a few go-toes like the mini baguette with hot pastrami, mustard, old cheese, pickles, and onions from 't Kuyltje; [Broodje Bert's](/posts/all-my-amsterdam-memories-gather-round-food#broodje-bert) signature burger sarnie; tomato-rubbed bread with Serrano ham from [Ibericus](/posts/all-my-amsterdam-memories-gather-round-food#ibericus); homemade pitas stuffed with dÃ¶ner from [Leeman](/posts/all-my-amsterdam-memories-gather-round-food#leeman-doner); the shoarma bun with hot sauce from [Mesut](/posts/all-my-amsterdam-memories-gather-round-food#grillroom-shoarma-mesut); toasties with a mixture of two kinds of cheese and three members of the onion family from [Caulils](/posts/all-my-amsterdam-memories-gather-round-food#caulils), and [Ram's Roti's](/posts/all-my-amsterdam-memories-gather-round-food#rams-roti) dangerously addictive chicken in peanut sauce pressed between more good ol' white bread.

Still, once I met G, my gastronomy explorations flared further as we rounded up the city's bar and restaurant scene and hosted many aperitivos and tiny dinners with [gourmet groceries](/posts/all-my-amsterdam-memories-gather-round-food#gourmet-groceries) and market hauls at our home in de Schimmelstraat. It's not an exaggeration to say that I have few memories of Amsterdam that don't involve entertaining or dining out.
