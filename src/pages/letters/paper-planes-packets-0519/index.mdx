Hi All!

**How have you been? ❤️**

Lately, I’ve been thinking about _wish-making_ again and how my wishes, as far as I can remember them, always come true.

Itja, a dear friend and spirit mother of sorts, calls me a _Zondagskind_, which literally means “someone who’s born on Sunday,” which I’m not, but in a figurative sense translates to “fortune’s favorite.”

Reading up on the term, I discovered that people used to believe a Zondagskind could predict the future. I considered it for a while.

But as much as I’d like to open my life to magic wholeheartedly, I can never seem to allow for more than a few sparks to enter through the cracks.

In the end, it makes sense. I might, in fact, be predicting my future. Because what I really think is happening is that my wishes are plans in disguise.

## Words

I published a new post about my next step as a web developer. It’s about how I decided to return to a career path that feels right and my plan to follow a self-designed master’s degree. Here’s how it starts:

> I have a moving image in my mind. The bottom half of it is taken up by sand, the color reminiscent of Cappuccino, a camel which I once befriended on another land of fine particles. The sky fills the top bit, and in between the two elements, there’s a shade of mantle green.. [r](/posts/leap-of-code/)[ead more](/posts/leap-of-code/)

## Code

⭐️ The first part of last month, I was practicing CSS and JavaScript and making glow-in-the-dark-stars-everything–like this [star rating](https://mirhamasala.github.io/star_rating/) and [starry sky](https://mirhamasala.github.io/starry_sky/) _(click anywhere on the screen to make a star appear)._

🍯 I started working on a design by Laura Crompton for _The Gatherists_. Here are the beginnings of the [landing page](https://mirhamasala.github.io/gatherists/).

🎓 I’m joining [Le Wagon Barcelona](https://www.lewagon.com/barcelona) as a teaching assistant in July & August.

## Quote That’s Been on My Mind Again

“You are never given a wish without also being given the power to make it true. You may have to work for it, however.” –Richard Bach in _Illusions_
