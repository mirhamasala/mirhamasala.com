Hi, All!

**Happy New Year!** 🌬✨

Reflecting on this year’s [end-of-year review](/letters/paper-planes-packets-1218/), I discovered that I’m doing better than ever.

My inner world is evolving.

And I’m more mature and kinder than I ever was.

Steadily, I’m able to recognize the negative and crowd it out with the positive.

I’m trusting to know when I need to say ‘no.’ And when another chance is one too many.

And there’s a path. And although I haven’t stopped trying yet, there’s the realization that I can’t do it all, after all.

In the day-to-day, this unfolding is lost on me, but in retrospect, it all becomes so clear.

Like how wonderful, _becoming_ can be.

## You

In 2019, the positive guides and supporters in my life outnumbered the negative influences.

I’m better than ever, in large part, because of *you*.

Your “thinking-of-yous,” your honesty, and wisdom, and kindness are weaved into my becoming.

Thank you for believing in me, for trusting me with [your fears and hopes](/letters/paper-planes-packets-0819/#a-birthday-wish), and for your replies of comfort [when I didn’t even know I needed them](/letters/paper-planes-packets-0219/).

But most of all, thank you for reminding me with each reply just how little we all are.

## Quote That’s Been On My Mind

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. –Theodore Roosevelt, “The Man in the Arena” via Brené Brown in _Daring Greatly_

Meet you in the arena,\
With much love,\
