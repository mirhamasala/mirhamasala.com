## The Birth Experience

I'm lying on my left side, gazing into G's waist, counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. A surge reaches, and I turn onto my back, knees drawn in, and push as hard as possible. On my side, it's just G and I, rolling in my oxytocin high, together moving towards meeting our boy. There's calm. Surrender. My dignity. Control. On my back, all the drama I read about, all the drama I wished to avoid, is threatening us: If there's no show of Dylan after the next push, _She_, is bringing the pump. I will not let her take the pump.

It's 26 hours after that first blissful contraction when I silently rolled off the bed with flutters in my gut and tiptoed to the bathroom. Despite my carefulness, G woke up, beaming, knowing without knowing that Dylan had announced his coming. I ran a bath, and in the tub, protected by darkness, vignetted with the flickers of a few candles and the clouded light shimmering through the glass brick wall dividing our bedroom and bathroom, I slipped in and out until dawn, counting, moaning, letting[^1].

Very early in my pregnancy, I knew I wanted a home birth. G didn't bite straight away, but after researching the alternatives, he was in. Home births are still the default in Holland[^2]. They're not, however, in Bosnia. My decision made my parents nervous, especially my mom. Although she tried not to burden me with her delivery stories, the unsaid words hovering in the pause between her parting lips spoke of trauma. She must've forgotten that I already knew about the gore bits.

Mom's first delivery, the birth of my brother, had been harrowing. She endured ten stitches and was unable to sit or walk for days (later suffering from engorgement and mastitis, too). Still, it's not her experience that troubled me. It was her fear that was worrisome. The books had been clear: tension from anyone present could threaten an uncomplicated delivery. I never followed through with the initial plan to invite her to witness her grandson's birth. And just like on my [wedding day](/posts/the-story-of-us#two-pops-and-a-knot), I'd miss her presence.

Come 8 a.m., G set off on his bike to get me a croissant from our [neighborhood bakery](https://www.mirhamasala.com/posts/all-my-amsterdam-memories-gather-round-food#fort-negen). Those buttered layers and a cookie with oats, dates, and cinnamon are what I'd munch on throughout the day while I moved from wall to wall, tub to bed, curtains drawn. Once my surges became periodic and predictable, the midwives checked on me every few hours. And each time, I'd tell them to go home. I was handling labor stoically and cherished the space. Then, for a reason I don't remember, a midwife I had never met was sent.

The stranger midwife's hair was drenched, and her breath reeked of alcohol. As soon as she stepped inside our home, I withdrew, steadily circling away from her into the corners of our walls. I didn't want her to come close, let alone touch me. I politely refused a check and said I'd wait for my regular midwives. She left, and I thought that was that. The days after Dylan was born, though, I'd question if this encounter had stalled my labor.

I had read how women's cervixes can reverse dilation if they perceive a threat[^3]. I can't know if that happened, but when my regular midwife returned, she noted little progress since the last time she visited. Worried that my labor was taking too long, she suggested breaking my water. I accepted, though torn about deviating from natural progression.

Had I waited and refused the intervention, would my body have caught up once it realized the threat was gone? Could I have prevented what was coming?

Red lights swirled in front of our house. It was 5 p.m., and I remember it dark. As soon as a surge passed, I flung our front door open and ran for it, two flights down. Face to face with the paramedics, I confirmed they were there for me, gesturing up when asked where my midwife was. I wrangled myself on the stretcher while assaulted by bright lights. Then, I heard G talking from someplace to someone (the front, the driver, I filled in the blanks), his voice sounding as if coming from a well, the bass to the wailing sirens above us.

We were moving fast, bouncing over roads that seemed to have been laid on giant mattress springs. I imagined Amsterdam's infamous bikers who stop for nobody, now making way for us. A first adventure for Dylan, I thought. What would he make of the commotion? One day, not far from then, he and I will flip through his _Cars & Trucks_ book, calling out _wee-oww wee-oww_. How many have imagined racing the streets in a truck straight from their childhood books? Yet, if they did, it probably wasn't for fun. _I_ had lost blood.

G had set up the birth bath smack in our living room, like all first-time parents, I imagine, about 20 hours too early. I wouldn't dip as much as a toe in it. G would then empty it, packing it back in its box in the same tidying-up streak as he changed the bed sheets, trashed the blood-stained remains, and readied our home for our return from the hospital. But even with the evidence out of sight, I'd still have to process the blow of the delivery deviating from our plans.

After the hospital staff hooked me up to the monitors, the paramedics soon deduced Dylan was fine. His heartbeat was as strong as ever. Our home birth, however, was no more. And the stress began.

As I moved, the cords attached to the machinery kept sliding off and triggering alarms. I was directed from one birthing position to another. I moved from my side to my knees. I crouched, then strained on a birthing stool. And round again, I went for hours while the entire delivery team demanded that I push harder. Unfortunately, I recognized none of their instructions in my body. My midwife and the obstetrician met outside the room now and then, their hushed tones a premonition of yet another intervention. There were numerous internal examinations from whom not. They inserted a catheter, presuming my blatter was blocking Dylan's exit. It was not. I remember pushing so hard I thought I'd burst my rectum. I remember screaming. And then, I broke as a young nurse badgered me to try harder still, an indignant look on her face when I gave up. That was itâ€“"No more," I said. "What do you want?" they asked. "I want him out," I replied. And with that announcement, worry was declared on all sides.

The doctor assumed I had nothing left to give. More interventions were proposed: oxytocin, an episiotomy, a vacuum, a combination of some, and all[^4]. Unable to conceive how Dylan was to come out, overwhelmed by how dark it had all turned, and afraid it would get worse, I consented to a drop of oxytocin.

The substance hit me in seconds, quieting the chaos around me. As the next surge swept through me, I finally grasped what everyone had been demanding as I absorbed the full force of a proper contraction for the first time. With my body taking over the lead again and G at my side, I returned inward once more to a resemblance of the state I had known at home.

And then, the top of Dylan's head appeared. Everyone cheered at once. G looked up at me in amazement and hope. I was granted a few more pushes than previously sanctioned. And like that[^5], caught by his father (after he reminded the medical staff that he should probably wash his hands first), at 01:36 on 14 March 2022, Dylan was born[^6][^7]. We met on my chest.

[^1]: I selected a few scents to mark the birth experience, choosing Marie-Stella-Maris Room Spray No.12 Objets d'Amsterdam and Byredo's Gypsy Water body cream. The former was a tribute to where I met G and the city where our boy was born. The latter served as [a beloved reminder of my travels](/posts/favorite-things-2019#most-memorable-travel-experience).
[^2]: Meaning that if you want to give birth in a hospital, you have to make a case for it (or finance it yourself). Be that as it may, more women are choosing to give birth in hospitals nowadays, with only [13.85% homebirths in 2021](https://www.staatvenz.nl/kerncijfers/bevallingen).

[^4]: (a) Synthetic **oxytocin**, a hormone, is often administered in medical settings to stimulate contractions during labor. It mimics the natural hormone's role in childbirth. (b) An **episiotomy** is a surgical cut made in the perineum (the area between the vaginal opening and the anus). It is performed to enlarge the vaginal opening for childbirth. (c) A **vacuum-assisted** delivery involves attaching a soft cup to the baby's head with a vacuum to help guide the baby through the birth canal during contractions.
[^5]: By _like that_, I mean _like that after_ experiencing the most intense phase known as crowning (where the baby's head fully stretches the vaginal opening). Although I had read about crowning, I hadn't grasped that I'd need to maintain that position for one or two contractions.
[^6]: Dylan weighed 2946 grams at birth and was born on G's parents' wedding anniversary.
[^7]: Despite the transfer to the hospital, my delivery was as natural as possible. I had a vaginal birth without pain relief, episiotomy, or the use of a vacuum. Each intervention required explicit consent, though we had to fight hard for our wishes. Nevertheless, we had to concede several other birth preferences, such as having a home birth, a water birth, the option not to break my waters, freedom of movement, not being directed when to push, avoiding the use of oxytocin, and not undergoing continuous monitoring.
