For weeks, I meant to go to Lisbon. And now that the day had come, I was making excuses.

It was 07:30 already. I still had to shower. Wash my hair. Besides, Dylan seemed to need me more this morning. And G didn't sleep well. The plants needed watering. The laundry needed folding. I hadn't written this letter yet. And did I _really_ want to go? Maybe what I needed was just a short beach walk.

And then, I had my breakfast. Showered. Took out the mascara. Threw an iPad and breast pump in my bag. And I called a cab while kissing G and Dylan goodbye.

I want to think I never made excuses for not doing things. And I certainly don't want to start now that I'm a parent.

**Hi, All!** How are you? ☀️ The three of us are settling well on Portugal's coast. We found a place at the seaside where we now spend stretches on the terrace doing nothing more than watching the surf. We picked up skateboarding again. And Dylan goes to a forest school in the mornings and spends his afternoons at the beach. I try to remind us that this was once the dream.

## Words

Index fund investing, PJs, parenting books, a 4000-kilometer road trip, raw everything, the no-tipping experiment, and a few more [2022 favorites](/posts/favorite-things-2022/).

## Code

I officially migrated my blog from WordPress to Next.js ([code is open source](https://github.com/mirhamasala/mirhamasala.com)). In the process, I learned about writing scripts, Node's File System module, and Abstract Syntax Trees. Then, I went overboard and used the same script to import all my content from The Spin-Off Project. That still needs some work, but I'm excited to own all my content. You can find my [posts](/posts) and [letters](/letters) on the [new site](/).
