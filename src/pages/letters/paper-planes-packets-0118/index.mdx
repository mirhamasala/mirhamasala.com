**Hi, All!**

I wanted to catch you ahead of the craze and wish you a happy New Year! 🌬✨

Thank you for sticking with me in 2017. I loved having you around.

## Decisions, Not Goals

New Year’s resolutions, goals, challenges.. love them or hate them, set them or don’t, they’re in the air anyhow.

For 2018, I wrote a list of decisions instead of goals. There’s a difference, I feel.

The idea is that decisions are done deals. They’re not up for debate like goals might be.

I can’t strive to achieve my decisions. I can’t fail or succeed at them. They’re already made, and all there is now is to let them be.

## My Decisions for 2018

Here are three of my decisions, which I’ve been preparing to make, in some way or another, in the past few years.

1. Quit sugar 🍭
2. Minimise shopping 🛒
3. Complete the 21-Day No-Complaint Challenge 🤐

The first two decisions come with a couple of footnotes, rules that I’ve written down ahead of time.

When it comes to quitting the white stuff, I’ll be adhering to the “I Quit Sugar” program by [Sarah Wilson](http://www.sarahwilson.com). Meaning moderate fruit consumption will be allowed, as well as self-made treats with stevia or rice malt syrup.

As for the shopping decision, I live a rather minimalist lifestyle as is but still feel I could be reigning in some parts. Especially, when it comes to gift-giving, app and book shopping, and doing superfood groceries.

And then, there’s the [no-complaint challenge](http://a.co/3LwCO7Z), which I already started last month. I’m about 40 days into the challenge. My longest streak was six days, but right now, I’m on day two.

## Words

I’ve one new post to share with you this month:

[California Pit Stops](/posts/california-pit-stops) ⛰ 🚗

I’m building up to being more vulnerable in my writing. But as I do, I want to make sure I don’t hurt myself or anyone else.

In this post, I’m opening up somewhat. It may not seem like much more than a crack to you, but to me, it feels like quite some.

If you’re not into vulnerability though, you can head straight for the bottom. That’s where the tacos and tri-tip steak sandwiches are.

With showers of love,\
Mirha\
