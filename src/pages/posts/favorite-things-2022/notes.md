With [The Knitting Club](/posts/the-knitting-club), I confronted my [fear of doing nothing](/posts/the-fear-list), and we discussed minimalism and personal finance.

I counted 2 React projects, 9 paper planes, and 25 finished books, 10000 kilometers of road-tripping.

In 2023,

I'm diving into the mundane.

And not taking on more than 3 big projects at once.

I also liked watching the documentary [Playing With Fire](https://www.playingwithfire.co/the-documentary), which helped me recommit to my version of frugal living.

When Dylan was born in March, I also opened a [DEGIRO](https://www.degiro.com/) account for Dylan, to which G and I [invested 3000 EUR](https://paulmerriman.com/how-time-can-turn-3000-into-50-million/). We also decided to move all the cash he gets from family into his account and plan to keep investing an annual sum for him ourselves.

**Plus, a couple more saving challenges:** This year, I also committed to asking for discounts and negotiating prices. And, I stopped buying expensive toiletries and household products.

## Most Memorable Travel Experience

- Then, there was the wine tasting in Caprino Veronese (Tenuta La Presa) with the courtyard all to ourselves. However, without even seeing the nearby Garda Lake, we dashed off to the other body of water.

- Chamonix. We glimpsed the Month Blanc in France.

- Specialty coffee at [Brumes](https://goo.gl/maps/YWzm2LQA1FTrJfVn7) in Annecy.

- The [specialty coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/RVG3V3xhTn2nfveL8) and long chat with an American lady in Annecy.

Exploring the old town of [Besalu](https://goo.gl/maps/vTDz4rR5GBtiejVR7) on an early, rainy morning on our own.

Fancy dinner in Lleida and staying in blabla.

G's parents meeting Dylan for the first time in Madrid. And staying with them in the beautiful castle in Toledo.

The [grand apartment in Estepona](https://goo.gl/maps/XuG8VVdHLieicpPu7) where we fell in a little condominium grove with our large kitchen and deliveries from the Corte Ingles.

[La Cala Resort](https://goo.gl/maps/LNM7v7ubZ1EXAFZq5) with flamenco performances in Malaga.

Screaming my lungs out on my first kiteboarding session in [Tarifa](https://goo.gl/maps/AqK9W4Ryw6eEVZWG6) after three years while Pedro my teacher had G and Dylan on the walkie-talkie. (But also the stone plate on which our meat was cooked). and dipping Dylan's toes in Tarifa's Atlantic Ocean.

Checking out of Barcel√≥ Isla Canela in one day because we hated it. But the gin/tonics at a chringuito nearby who played drum and bass for us.

And then finally arriving in our dear place in Santo Isidoro where long before Dylan was born we had the idea to buy land.
