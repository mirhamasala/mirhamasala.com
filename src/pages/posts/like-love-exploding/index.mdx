As if standing in a nightscape blessed by Bob Ross himself.

Above us a circle of friendly treetops and shades of darkness I was yet to see.

Stars.

Around, us. And nothing but silence. A sound so intense I can almost hear it.

Hugged by life. Hearts wide open. We dance.

_Who loves like this anyway?_
