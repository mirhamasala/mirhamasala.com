**Hi All,**

**How have you been?** 🤗

I decided to bring back *artist dates* into my life. Artist dates are dates that I plan with myself, and then force myself to go on.

You’d be surprised to find out just how difficult it is to show up for a date with yourself.

After four rounds of dates (one round is 12 weeks/dates), however, I’ve learned to ignore the resistance, by realizing that I never regret going on one.

As soon as I finish drafting this letter, I have another date scheduled. I’m off to a cafe in the hood for a pot of tea and to watch a [masterclass by Gordon Ramsay](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/gordon-ramsay-teaches-cooking).

🔖 Artist dates and morning journaling are the two main exercises in [_The Artist’s Way_](/posts/favorite-things-2017/#artists-way)

## September Equinox

My last week’s artist date was a guided meditation. It was quite a special meditation as it aligned with the September Equinox.

As I came to learn, this period is the perfect time for reflecting on our achievements for this year so far and also for planning new goals.

And so, I did just that and revisited the goals and decisions that I set at the beginning of this year.

I soon realized that I already checked off most of my goals. And although I did sharpen a few decisions, I left them mainly unchanged. I also planned ahead but decided that these new ideas and commitments belong to the year to come.

Thus, I’ll be using these last few months of 2018 to finish things and tye up some loose ends. But mostly though, I’ll be winding down and appreciating everything that I already achieved.

## Current Favorites

I found out some pesky cells are lining up my cervix. It’s not cancer and treatment is available. Nevertheless, before I commit to a procedure, I’d like to try and fight these bad boys myself.

I decided to start following a ketogenic diet, combined with full-on fasting days, and intermittent fasting for the next three months, to try purge the abnormal cells.

I’ve only been looking into these metabolic therapies for a few weeks now, but the bit of research that is available is promising. The health benefits seem more than worth the try.

As I’m still at the beginning of my research, I don’t want to get too much into some of the resources below. Instead, if any of this sounds interesting to you, I encourage you to start your own research.

### Keto Tools

📋 [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) · App for tracking your diet. It has great support for the ketogenic diet and also syncs with your Apple Health App.

🌡 [Keto-Mojo](https://keto-mojo.com/) · The device that I use to measure my glucose and keto levels

🍳 [DietDoctor](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto/recipes) · For keto recipes that don’t look disgusting

🥥 [Perfect Keto](https://shop.perfectketo.com/) · I’m using the *MCT Oil Powder* and _Exogenous Ketone Base_. The company’s marketing is off the charts, no doubt, but I’d like to think that I chose them because they use far less crappy ingredients in their products than their competition.

### App I’m Loving

👑 [Flo](https://flo.health/)\
Now that I’m off the pill, I use Flo to track my period. I also use it to track my weight, mood, symptoms, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and any other parameters that I find noteworthy. Furthermore, Flo is helping me to understand my reproductive system, of which, I’m ashamed to admit, I had very little knowledge about.

### Purchase I’m Crazy Excited About

🥑 [Vitamix S30](http://www.selfridges.com/SG/en/cat/vitamix-s30-blender_309-3003266-58373/)\
A long time ago, when I thought I’d be starting my first office job, I promised myself that I would get a Chanel 2.55 with my first salary. But it turns out, years later, that I’d much rather have a Vitamix.
