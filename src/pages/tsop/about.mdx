In pursuit of happiness, fulfillment and search for work I love, I created The Spin-Off Project: a lifestyle design experiment that allows me to discover my talents, develop my skills and find my passions.

After earning a master’s degree in European Studies, I was accepted for an internship at the Embassy of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Holland.

Four months of politics later, while working directly for the ambassador, it became clear to me that I wasn’t going to be pursuing a career in foreign affairs after all.

I had bet my future on the wrong horse and was now stuck with a useless degree in one pocket and the other .. _nothing_. No dreams, no big passions and no extraordinary talents.

If I was ever going to be successful, I needed to figure out what I’m good at and what I love doing most in life.

Thus, in search of true happiness and work I love, I created *The Spin-Off Project*: a lifestyle design experiment that allows me to discover my talents, develop my skills and find my passions.

It all comes down to a list of 12 different lifestyles to which I’ve dedicated a year of my life to exploring one each month. This is what my list looks like:

### My Spin-Off List

1. [Be a Polyglot](/tsop/posts/polyglot-month/)
2. [Be an Artist](/tsop/posts/artist-month/)
3. [Be a Kiteboarder](/tsop/posts/kiteboarder-month/)
4. [Be a Philanthropist](/tsop/posts/philanthropist-month/)
5. [Be a Dancer ](/tsop/posts/dancer-month/)
6. [Be an Entrepreneur](/tsop/posts/entrepreneur-month/)
7. [Be a Reader](/tsop/posts/reader-month/)
8. [Be a Snowboarder](/tsop/posts/snowboarder-month/)
9. [Be a Traveler](/tsop/posts/30-days-traveling/)
10. [Be a Meditator](/tsop/posts/meditator-month/)
11. [Be a Surfer](/tsop/posts/surfer-month/)
12. [Be a Photographer](/tsop/posts/photographer-month/)

Instead of betting five years of my life on one possible career as I did with my studies, I now get to explore 12 different lifestyles and find out in just one year if any of them is worth pursuing for a lifetime.
