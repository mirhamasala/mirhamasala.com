“Stop thinking you are special,” G told me once while I whined about what I believed to be a uniquely dark, lonesome moment in my life.

It was a comment that shook me at first yet also turned out to be one of the most valuable observations G would ever cast over me.

A remark that humbled and matured me and permitted me to start dropping my stories.

My worries.

Family history.

Complaints.

Self-inflicted busyness.

Astrological sign.

Myers-Briggs type.

Diet convictions.

Dreams.

Dramas.

Appearance.

Hobbies.

The elaborate design of all of them combined, which I thought made *me*, but actually only perpetuated a self-image that held me back and made me boring and exhausting to be around with.

On the other hand, stopping to believe I was somehow different than everyone else helped shed some of my worst narcissism and childishness and allowed me to narrow the gap between *them,* *you*, and me.

And over the years, it’s our shared humanity, non-specialness, and sameness that has become ever-so evident to me, which I find remarkable and where I like to meet.

## Warriors Challenge

In January, four friends and I picked a habit each and committed to dedicating 20 minutes daily. For every day one failed to practice their routine of choice, they paid €5. At the end of the month, the people who didn’t miss any day got to divide the bounty.

The habits were: reading non-work-related books, doing yoga, meditating, studying AI-generated art, and for me, _writing_.

A few of us liked the January challenge so much that we decided to keep going with two new people for February and March (and two new habits: ice baths and drawing.) Also, to make the challenge more interesting, we set the bounty to €5 per person, so failing a day now costs €25.

This challenge helped me publish [Favorite Things 2021](/posts/favorite-things-2021/) and update the above post, both somewhat evolved tasks in what tend to be busy months. Plus, I sent two letters with today’s marking day 65 of writing in a row without fail. I wholeheartedly recommend doing a challenge like this of your own.
