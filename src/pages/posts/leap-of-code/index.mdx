I have a moving image in my mind. The bottom half of it is taken up by sand, the color reminiscent of Cappuccino, a camel which I once befriended on another land of fine particles. The sky fills the top bit, and in between the two elements, thereâ€™s a shade of mantle green, HSL(124, 7%, 57%). In the foreground, is _me_.

Iâ€™m standing on a beach, stepping on the caramel dust, wearing pants with a print of a coral reef. And Iâ€™d want to say itâ€™s Nemoâ€™s home thatâ€™s depicted, but then again, I donâ€™t know all that much about fish, or where they like to live.

In the background, people are kiteboarding, zigging and zagging on the green. Mr. G is here too, but out of frame, filming _me_, while I attempt to do a cartwheel.

Itâ€™s 2013, and Iâ€™m in Cumbuco, Brazil. I didnâ€™t know it then, but I was living what would become the most important chapter of my life story yet, [The Spin-Off Project](/tsop).

My first job as a junior developer began with a dazzling intro. I was offered a remote position that paid well, promised code reviews and one-on-ones with a senior dev, and ultimately flown to France for two weeks of training. The only requirement? That Iâ€™d be willing to learn.

It was, of course, too good to be true. The rules of the game started changing from day one, and just a few weeks in I found myself in a job for which I hadnâ€™t applied. At the same time, I struggled to understand whether to stay or not.

During this period, I began using _The Daily Stoic Journal_, whose daily reflections prompted me to meditate on questions like _What do I find important in life?_ As I thought about the answers, the memory, of me, cartwheeling on that beach, kept replaying in my mind.

While I watched myself from a distance, living The Spin-Off Project, my present appeared so mundane compared to the recent past. And I realized I had diverged into a path that wasnâ€™t mine.

As I further contemplated my next step as a developer, I concluded that I didnâ€™t care so much about what that next step would be, as long as it would make for a good story, as The Spin-Off Project had done.

## Creating my own masterâ€™s in web development

2013 was also the year that I met [Victor Saad](http://victorsaad.com/) and learned about his 12-in-12 project.

Instead of going to grad school, Victor decided to take a leap and create his own MBA. He picked twelve experiences centered around design and business and dedicated a month to doing each. Victor then went on to invite people around the world to leap with him and called itÂ *The Leap Year Project.*

A few weeks ago, I got back in touch with Victor and told him I was ready to redeem my rain check. Building upon Victorâ€™s idea, Iâ€™m reserving the coming year to learn and grow as a developer by designing my own masterâ€™s in web development.

### The Curriculum

Instead of assigning a time limit to each experience, I decided to approach my leap more like a bucket list and add a few items that I want to check off in the next year or so.

**1. Be a teaching assistant for Le Wagon**\
Le Wagon is the coding boot camp that I graduated from in April 2018. This time around, I went back as a teaching assistant. I taught the front-end module in Bali, JavaScript, Rails, project weeks in Barcelona, and object-oriented programming in Singapore.

**2. Collaborate with a designer**\
I worked with [Laura](https://www.lacromp.com/) on a [mock page for The Gatherists](https://mirhamasala.github.io/gatherists/) ([code](https://github.com/mirhamasala/gatherists)). And we also collaborated on [Wagon City Guides](https://github.com/mirhamasala/lw_city_guide) ([code](https://github.com/mirhamasala/lw_city_guide) // [design](<https://www.figma.com/file/bU6KtCjRsrnSN79THTTEvk/le-wagon-city-guide-(2.0)>)).

_Cheeky fact: Laura and I met while surfing in [Sri Lanka](/travel-archives#sri-lanka). We daydream about opening a web agency with a cafÃ© on the ground floor. I call her Cookie._

**3. Create a web app with a senior developer**\
I created [Wagon City Guides](http://wagon-city-guides.herokuapp.com/) ([code](https://github.com/mirhamasala/lw_city_guide) // [design](<https://www.figma.com/file/bU6KtCjRsrnSN79THTTEvk/le-wagon-city-guide-(2.0)>)), a city guide app for Le Wagonâ€™s campuses, with the mentorship of [Federico](https://kundeveloper.com/).

**4. Work on a project with a small team**\
For ten weeks, I worked with seven other women via [\<how-i-can>](http://howican.tech/) on a positive news app called [Perch](https://github.com/how-i-can/news).

**5. Teach the frontend basics to beginner devs**\
I was the frontend mentor for [Subvisualâ€™s summer camp program](https://subvisual.com/blog/posts/apprenticeship-and-summer-camp-programs/)

**6. Write my first tech article**

**7. Prepare and give a workshop**

**8. Do an apprenticeship with a company that uses Rails**\
I joined TourHero and then stayed as their front-end developer.

**9. Volunteer**\
I gave a [coding workshop for Girls in Tech Singapore](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-your-landing-page-with-techtalk-girls-in-tech-and-le-wagon-singapore-tickets-103657592650).

Looking from a distance, living somebody elseâ€™s idea of comfortable, I wondered if Iâ€™d ever leap again. It turns out, the answer is _yes_.
