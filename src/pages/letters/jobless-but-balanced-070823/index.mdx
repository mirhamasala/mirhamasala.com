When I was let go, my instinct was to protect my mental state. Job searching can be such a taxing drag.

I didn't have to think long about a strategy. By now, I know my personal happiness formula. It involves steady doses of meditation, journaling, gratitude practice, surfing, sunbaths, and walks and talks with friends.

Thus, that's what I doubled down on while keeping studying, coding, and eating my daily frog: researching companies and applying.

Despite the uncertainty and intensity of the hunt, I led a more balanced life than I had in months.

I relished in the mundane. And still, I got things done.

When the void overtook me, I didn't bury it in _more_. Instead, I trusted the stillness.

There was a lightness to my days. Flow.

Ironic, sure. But jobless, I achieved the elusive work-life balance.

**Hi, All!** How are you? 🍉 I'm savoring the abundant summer days with expeditions to nearby sands and villages, sun-drenched Vermouth potations at my favorite taberna, and elaborate barbecues with farm-sourced produce bringing back childhood tastes like those of stone fruit and simple dishes like heirloom tomatoes with olive oil, vinegar, and salt. And come Monday, I start my new job, thrilled about the work and optimistic about preserving that precious balance.

## Words

In Amsterdam, perusing the local scene and sharing my finds with friends, I considered creating my first city guide, The Girl With The Blueprint (TGWTB). I moved on from TGWTB, but my desire for others to experience places like locals remains. Here's how it starts:

> When I think of Amsterdam, I recall racing G through the night by bike following a date at speakeasy Door 74, spotting Carly in the crowd just in time for one of our bottomless gin tonics at Wolvenstraat and a weekend of hotspot hunting with Arjen for my city guide. – [All My Amsterdam Memories Gather Round Food (+ My Favorite Spots)](/posts/all-my-amsterdam-memories-gather-round-food)

## Code

I added a map feature to this site, which I can use to show my favorite spots in city posts like the one about [Singapore](/posts/goodbye-little-red-dot#singapore-favorites) or on this [map page](/map) that will show all my favorites in one place.

It's a feature that I've wanted for a while and makes my entry into web development, which started with me hiring an agency in 2012 to create TGWTB, now coming full circle with my own integrated city guide.
