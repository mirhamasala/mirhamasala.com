Hi, All!

**How have you been?** 😌

I write to you from a battlefield of broken “just-after-thises.”

Except for a trace of blank pages, I don’t have much to show for. Unless, of course, that sorted sock drawer is somehow of any interest to you.

No, I do apologize. This was never my intention.

On the contrary, I was hoping to tell you about _Resistance_. And how I tamed him by making him my friend.

But when I tried to put it in writing, at last, he was gone, and _Guilt_ had taken his place.

If it weren’t for you, I’d probably be doing admin now.

## Words

I lost my Kindle the other week. And I may have done it on purpose.

I was reading a bit too much, soaking in other people’s ideas, delaying putting down mine.

Thus the upside of not being able to read more is that I got to rekindle with the blank screen and add five finished reads to _Read 100 Business Books_.

As usual, I’ve included all my favorite quotes and lessons learned from each book.

- [How to Fight a Hydra](/read-100-books#46-how-to-fight-a-hydra)
- [It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work](/read-100-books#47-it-doesnt-have-to-be-crazy-at-work)
- [The War of Art](/read-100-books#45-the-war-of-art)
- [On Writing](/read-100-books#44-on-writing)
- [The Obstacle Is the Way](/read-100-books#43-the-obstacle-is-the-way)

## Code

👩🏻‍💻 Last week I was invited to be a coding mentor at a workshop in Melbourne.

🎓 Also, I’ll be joining [Le Wagon Bali](https://www.lewagon.com/bali) as a teaching assistant for the frontend module in May.

## Quote That’s Been on My Mind

> The warrior and the artist live by the same code of necessity, which dictates that the battle must be fought anew every day. —Steven Pressfield, _The War of Art_

Sending you courage, and love,\
