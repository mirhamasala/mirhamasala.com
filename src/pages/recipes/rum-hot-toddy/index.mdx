Last week, while triumphantly unwinding in front of our already-lit Christmas tree, I was inspired to make a Hot Toddy. Since G doesn't like the whiskey version much, I tried rum. And I think it's even better.

## Ingredients

- 175 ml of hot water[^1]
- 45 ml of rum[^2]
- 10 ml of honey (opt for raw, if available)
- 20 ml of fresh lemon juice
- 1 lemon wheel

## Method

1. Combine all the ingredients in a mug or heatproof glass. Stir until the honey dissolves.
2. Garnish with the lemon wheel.

[^1]: If you have a temperature-regulated kettle, set it to 90°C. Without one, you'll have to wait longer until you can start drinking–that's all.
[^2]: I like Zacapa No. 23 - The better the quality of the rum, the better the drink.
