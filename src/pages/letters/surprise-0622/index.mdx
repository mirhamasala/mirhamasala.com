What surprised me most about the past months was discovering how wildly different life with a baby is from one without. And how oblivious I was to how most people, _parents_, experience the day-to-day joys and sorrows of life.

Becoming a parent closed this gap and made me more empathic towards the moms and dads raising kids and, at the same time, making the world go round.

Though overall, my compassion for all humans seems to have expanded. Just by witnessing Dylan’s innocence and spending a hilarious morning walk imagining everyone we crossed as the baby they once were.

And yet this isn’t a recommendation–and that, in turn, is no complaint. It’s just the reality that overcame me as a surprise.

💫 _Inspired by sparkly soul Seren, who asked me what surprised me most about becoming a parent._

**Hi, All!** How are you? ☀️ G and I drove with Dylan from Sarajevo to the south of Spain. It was both the most challenging and beautiful road trip we’ve made. We’ll be hugging the coast for a few more weeks before making our way to Portugal again.

On a different note, I’ll be pausing my letters in their current monthly format for the rest of the year. I want to keep the promise I made to myself to focus on [one big thing](/letters/one-big-thing-0222/) this year. And I’m also hoping to experiment with keeping in touch in a new way. Let’s see how I go.

## Quote That’s On My Mind

> All the best arguments that parents and the childless muster about which of their lives is the more rational, satisfying, and/or morally superior are about as interesting to me as the ongoing debate about Which Are Better: Cats or Dogs. –Tim Kreider, “The End of The Line” in [Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed](https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Shallow-Self-Absorbed-Sixteen-Decision-ebook/dp/B00JI0W6VE) by Meghan Daum
