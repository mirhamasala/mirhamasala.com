Whatâ€™s missing?

What brought me here?

What am I trying to prove?

What would life look like if I had nothing to prove, not even to myself?

We were four days into the second week of [The Habit List](/posts/the-knitting-club#chapter-iv-the-habit-list), and these had been my Most Important Questions so far.

For the fourth chapter of [The Knitting Club](/posts/the-knitting-club/), Devon, Silvia, and I had chosen to practice three habits for three weeks.

One of the habits, the Most Important Question, required giving the mind an overnight question.

Halfway through the chapter, examining not only my own inquiries but also those of Devon and Silvia, I certainly wished weâ€™d cheer up by the end of the week.

I seemed to have turned the practice into daily therapy sessions, which wasnâ€™t quite the purpose.

I was hoping to use the habit to solve coding puzzles and boost my creativity (On the fifth day I changed course and asked: What should I write about next?)

In the same week, I happened to be readingÂ [The Psychedelic Explorerâ€™s Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Psychedelic-Explorers-Guide-Therapeutic-Journeys-ebook/dp/B0051OHLVG/)Â when the following passage struck me:

> As can be seen, women were more likely to take a substance for self-healing. Men take a substance significantly more often out of curiosity, to undergo a spiritual experience or a mystical experience, and to better appreciate music. In fact, men were more likely to have taken psychedelics for all reasons except self-healing.

For all the reasonsÂ *except*Â self-healing? I gasped. How relaxing, I thought, not to have self-improvement as your primary intention. But instead, to want to witness the wonders of life, satisfy your curiosity, and amplify your enjoyment of music.

For a moment, I considered my next nomination:Â *How can I be more like a man?*Â But then I realized that question put me back to square one.

How can I be more like a man? Only a woman would wonder.

## Words

This April, Devon, Silvia, and I started [The Knitting Club](/posts/the-knitting-club/). Itâ€™s one of the most important and fun things Iâ€™ve ever done with friends.

If you only read one of my posts this year, make it [this one](/posts/the-knitting-club/). I hope it inspires you to start something similar.

## Code

Last week, we launched a side project at TourHero: [Project Travel Reopening](https://www.tourhero.com/en/ultimate-guide-covid19-travel-restrictions-reopening/). Itâ€™s a guide to travel restrictions with reports on where and when we can travel again. The project is open-source (coded in Vue.js), and youâ€™re very much invited to contribute.

## Quote Thatâ€™s Been On My Mind

> Only those who have cultivated the art of living completely in the present have any use for making plans for the future, for when the plans mature they will be able to enjoy the results. â€“James Fadiman, _The Psychedelic Explorerâ€™s Guide_
