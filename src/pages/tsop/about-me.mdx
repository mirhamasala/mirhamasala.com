Born in [Sarajevo](/travel-archives#sarajevo), Bosnia and Herzegovina. Grown in Delft, The Netherlands.

Fled the small Dutch town as soon as I reached the age of 18 and moved to glorious Amsterdam for European Studies and parties.

Pursued a career in foreign affairs but then dropped the dream when I found out only aliens work in politics.

Needed a new dream/career/lifestyle, so decided to try out 12 different ones in 1 year and travel the world.

Mr. G suggested I publish this outrageous undertaking online, and I thought, “Why not?”

Set up thespinoffproject.com and in the process fell in love with blogging.

Visited more than 20 countries, lived in some, and tried 12 different lifestyles in the last six years.

Been a [polyglot](/tsop/posts/polyglot-month/), [artist](/tsop/posts/artist-month/), [kiteboarder](/tsop/posts/kiteboarder-month/), [philanthropist](/tsop/posts/philanthropist-month/), [dancer](/tsop/posts/dancer-month/), [entrepreneur](/tsop/posts/entrepreneur-month/), [reader](/tsop/posts/reader-month/), [snowboarder](/tsop/posts/snowboarder-month/), [traveler](/tsop/posts/30-days-traveling), [meditator](/tsop/posts/meditator-month/), [surfer](/tsop/posts/surfer-month/) and [photographer](/tsop/posts/photographer-month/).

Now in Singapore, checking off my [bucket list](/tsop/posts/bucket-list#the-bucket-list) and learning to code.
