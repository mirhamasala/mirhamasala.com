### Radio Silence

An eternity passed, and I can’t think of saying anything important enough to break the silence. Every attempt I do, every sentence I write, feels so hollow. I don’t know how yet, but I’ll make my way back to you. I won’t let this radio silence turn into *forever.*

### People Who Code

Last week Joy Seng invited me to be a coding mentor for the Git/GitHub 101 workshop organized by Le Wagon and Women Who Code in Melbourne.

It would be my first time helping others code. I was well prepared. And not too nervous.

I figured I would love it or hate it. And that the worst thing that could happen was that I’d answer a question I didn’t know the answer to.

It didn’t occur to me, however, that the experience would have less to do with my insecurities, and more with helping the attendees get over theirs.

While I saw my own beginner’s doubt reflected in theirs, at the same time, I also realized just how much easier it all is from where I’m standing now, only a year and a half later.

When the evening ended, all I wished for was a magic wand with which I would’ve installed a whisper in their beginner’s minds that would echo whenever they get stuck or struggle to understand something: _Don’t doubt yourself. It’s not you. There’s no such thing as being good or bad at coding. Just keep at it._
