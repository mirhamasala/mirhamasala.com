Hi All!

**How have you been?** 😌

I write to you from a battlefield of broken “just-after-thises.”

Except for a trace of blank pages, I don’t have much to show for. Unless, of course, that sorted sock drawer is somehow of any interest to you.

No, I do apologize. This was never my intention.

On the contrary, I was hoping to tell you about _Resistance_. And how I tamed him by making him my friend.

But when I tried to put it in writing, at last, he was gone, and _Guilt_ had taken his place.

If it weren’t for you, I’d probably be doing admin now.

## Words

I lost my Kindle the other week. And I may have done it on purpose.

I was reading a bit too much, soaking in other people’s ideas, delaying to put down mine.

Thus the upside of not being able to read more is that I got to rekindle with the blank screen and add five finished reads to “Read 100 (Business) Books.”

As usual, I’ve included all my favorite quotes and lessons learned for each book.

- [How to Fight a Hydra](/posts/read-100-books/#how-to-fight-a-hydra)
- [It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work](/posts/read-100-books/#it-doesnt-have-to-be-crazy-at-work)
- [The War of Art](/posts/read-100-books/#the-war-of-art)
- [On Writing](/posts/read-100-books/#on-writing)
- [The Obstacle Is the Way](/posts/read-100-books/#the-obstacle-is-the-way)

## Code

👩🏻‍💻 Last week I was invited to be a coding mentor at a workshop in Melbourne.

🎓 Also, I’ll be joining [Le Wagon Bali](https://www.lewagon.com/bali) as a teaching assistant for the frontend module in May.

## Quote That’s Been on My Mind

“The warrior and the artist live by the same code of necessity, which dictates that the battle must be fought anew every day.” —Steven Pressfield, _The War of Art_

Sending you courage, and love,\
