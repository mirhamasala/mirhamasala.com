My mom always made this when I had a cold as a kid. Nowadays, G and I have it for breakfast and sometimes after a light dinner. I like mine hot. G prefers his warm to preserve more of the nutrients in raw milk.

## Ingredients

- 200 ml of raw milk
- 30 grams of grass-fed butter
- 1 teaspoon raw honey

## Method

Heat all ingredients in a pot until the butter is melted and the milk has reached your desired temperature. Stir and serve.[^1]

[^1]: If you want a frothier cup, blitz the liquid in a blender for 30 seconds after heating. For a thicker beverage, add a raw egg while blending.
