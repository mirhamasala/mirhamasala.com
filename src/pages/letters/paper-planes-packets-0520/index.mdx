Hi, All!

**How have you been?** üå§

When the virus took hold of the world, one of my first thoughts was that I was going to need a system that would prevent me from going crazy or becoming too sad.

I worried that certain blues and issues, which would be hiding in the backwaters of my regular life, would now surface into plain sight, only magnified by the new reality and void.

Yet, when this happened, I didn‚Äôt want to numb these emotions with bad habits and avoidance mechanisms.

I resolved to be observant and accepting, but I also began thinking about how to take some control over the situation, and make these restricted times, times of growth, and value.

That‚Äôs when I decided to renew my commitment to building good habits.

Every day,

I get up at dawn and take a walk to the sunrise.

I meditate.

I do my rehabilitation exercises.

I write.

I make time to learn new coding skills.

I speak Spanish to G whenever I remember.

I call my parents. And my parents-in-law.

I have long talks with my friends.

I read.

My¬†commitment to deepening good habits is also crowding out the shallow, superficial, and flimsy ones. I trimmed down my social media usage to _mostly none_, canceled my Netflix account, went back to ignoring the news altogether, and moderated my drinking and shopping habits.

With nowhere to go, and life becoming more routine, I‚Äôve had no excuse not to stick to forming good habits. I‚Äôm keeping to them better than ever, and at last, some practices are becoming ingrained into my life.

The good habits have acted as a safety net for whatever came up in the emptiness. And, at the same time, they turned out to be the essentials that are making my life fuller.

## Words

- [Make Good Art](/read-100-books#57-make-good-art)

## Code

A lot has happened since my [last coding update in February](/letters/paper-planes-packets-0220#code): I worked on a React app with seven other women, did more than fifteen pairings/mentoring sessions last month alone, and I joined the team at TourHero as a UI engineer. I‚Äôll also be giving a workshop for Girls in Tech in May (for which you can¬†[sign up here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-your-landing-page-with-techtalk-girls-in-tech-and-le-wagon-singapore-tickets-103657592650)).

## Current Favorites

### Band I‚Äôve Been Playing On Repeat

üé∏ [The Paper Kites](http://thepaperkites.com.au)\
If you want to check out just one of their songs, try [Living Colour](https://open.spotify.com/track/3pFSEgLmKkETBWGj9NspK3?si=5ZPZWpMETqmIeoa9OxbvWw). Hat tip to Mr. G for discovering the band.

### The Documentaries That Made Me Teary-Eyed

üé¨ [The Salt of The Earth](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salt_of_the_Earth_(2014_film)>), [I Am Not Your Negro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Not_Your_Negro), and [The Biggest Little Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Biggest_Little_Farm)\
Three weeks ago, I started a movie club with two friends. And these are the documentaries that each of us recommended‚Äîordered in the degree of most tissues used.

üß∂ **Cheeky fact:** When one friend mentioned that she doesn‚Äôt really watch movies, we morphed from being a movie club to [The Knitting Club](/posts/the-knitting-club/). Nobody‚Äôs knitting, though. The idea is to have rotating themes. For the upcoming round, we‚Äôll be testing recipes.

### Favorite New App

üêù [Pure Nature ‚Äì 3D Soundscapes by Lang Elliott](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/pure-nature-3d-soundscapes/id1357380255)\
I listen to thunderstorms falling into a Saturday siesta, the waves while easing into yoga postures, and I let crickets guide my writing. Make sure to listen to Lang‚Äôs nature recordings on your headphones, though, since the sound isn‚Äôt nearly as spacious and real when played on speakers.

### On My Wine Wish List

üç∑ [Pittacum Aurea 2012, Spain](https://www.vivino.com/pittacum-aurea/w/1425807?year=2012)\
Mr. G was offered a taste of the Aurea by Chip Steel, the sommelier of [Preludio](https://preludio.sg). After which, I, to Mr. G‚Äôs envy, ordered a full glass for myself. It was the last wine I drank before the city went on lockdown. The same evening, Chip also introduced me to the [Movia Sauvignon 2012](https://www.vivino.com/movia-sauvignon/w/1496114?year=2012) from Slovenia, which was good enough for me to suggest a family wine trip for when we can travel again.

### Skincare Product I‚Äôm Loving

‚≠êÔ∏è [Retinol 1% in Squalane by The Ordinary](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-retinol-1pct-in-squalane-30ml)\
This retinol solution is keeping my skin looking great. Keep in mind, though, that you‚Äôll need to build up your skin‚Äôs tolerance for retinol, lest you end up donning a lobster look. I started with the 0.2% solution, followed by 0.5%, and only then moved to the highest strength of 1%. Repeat after me: ‚ÄúI will not start with the highest retinol strength.‚Äù
