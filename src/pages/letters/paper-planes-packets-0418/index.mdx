Hi, All!

**How have you been?**

I just came back home from two weeks of yoga and surf in Sri Lanka. It was precisely what I wished for after two months of coding: a shitty internet connection and a focus on my body rather than my brain.

Tomorrow though, I’m getting back to coding. And I won’t lie. I’m scared. Scared of being overwhelmed. Afraid to find out I know nothing.

Fear seems to be following me around lately.

Right after the coding bootcamp, I had to dare myself to shoot street portraits again. One stranger in and my fear disappeared, at least for an afternoon.

In Sri Lanka, I faced my old fear of waves. And I started chasing the bigger ones at the end of my trip. I still hear myself saying to another surfer: “Just because I’m afraid, doesn’t mean I’m not brave.”

I’ll hold on to that tomorrow. I’ll let myself be afraid and then do what I need to do anyway. But it doesn’t mean I’m not scared.

## Words

I have a new post up: [Beautiful Stranger](/posts/beautiful-stranger). It’s a story about facing fear, inspired by my dare to ask strangers in Canggu (Bali) if I could take their portrait. Here’s how it starts:

> I saw him from a distance. His amber-blonde curls and sun-painted face drew me in. His freckles made him look older than he was, I observed. Australian, I guessed.

In the same post, you’ll also find a before and after version of a photograph that I edited following a photo retouching class.

## Code

The final coding project I did with my team during the bootcamp: Waterfall. It’s an app that allows you to create charts simply.
