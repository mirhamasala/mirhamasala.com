Hi All!

**How are you?** 🌬❤

I spent my weeks ruminating on the answer to the darkest question of all: _What should I do with my life?_

Such. Fun.

It wasn’t until today, however, that I realized it’s not that I don’t know the answer, it’s that I’m asking for guarantees.

I want to be sure that I won’t regret having taken this path.

Now that’s what I want–but here’s what I got:

As long as the choices that I make are mine, I’ll be fine.

## Code & Words

The answer is code and write. And that, too, I know, is asking for a lot. I’m still learning how to be both a blogger and a developer.

Part of it means accepting that projects take longer to finish and that the learning curve is flat-ish. And that’s hard.

But, I’m finding my way in sharing the process and not just the polished parts.

Both the breathe bubble and post are works in progress, and yet both are also useable as they are.

## Quote That’s Been on My Mind

> Like most writers, I feel like a reprobate who does not deserve to live on any day that I do not write, but I also feel that four or five hours is enough to earn my stay on the planet for one more day. —Tim Kreider, [The ‘Busy’ Trap](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/)

Sending you palm trees, and many hugs,\
