On The Reset Edition of [Slow Retreats](/posts/the-making-of-slow-retreats/), Silvia gave a workshop on minimalism and gifted us the book [Essential: Essays by The Minimalists](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Minimalists-Joshua-Fields-Millburn-ebook/dp/B005O0JNQS). It also turned out to be the perfect choice for her Knitting Club chapter, for which we read two book chapters each week, implementing The Minimalists’ advice as we went.
