My first artistic project, Memory Bytes, is about revenge, memories and the art of letting go. Follow me through the dark of the night as I rid myself of my past and mature in the process.

For years I kept love letters from ex-partners. I also kept notes from friends; tickets and “souvenirs” from travels; and other pieces and bits that reminded me of a day in my life that I wished to remember.

I thought many times of doing something creative with these _memory boxes_, but didn’t know what.

And then this year, as soon as I decided to be an [artist for a month](/tsop/posts/artist-month), I quickly came up with an idea.

The memorabilia would play the main role in what was to become my first artistic project, Memory Bytes.

## The Ideas Behind Memory Bytes

### Revenge and the Digitalization of Memories

The initial idea that I had for Memory Bytes was to photograph every piece of paper, letter or object and display these photos in an (online) gallery–making for a very private and dramatic showpiece.

The emotions and questions that I wished to explore by showcasing this sheer amount of photos were the following:

1. Should we hold on to old love letters?
2. To whom do love letters belong once a relationship has ended?
3. Is it morally justifiable to publicly display love letters from ex-partners and notes from ex-friends?
4. In an ever-changing digital world, what form and place does the love letter take? And what do memories look like?

As soon as I started photographing each letter and object, it became clear that this was going to be a very time-consuming task. It felt wrong to be spending that amount of time in my past.

A wave of observations and essential lessons came over me. They turned my thinking and emotions upside down and I quickly abandoned the idea of photographing and displaying the memorabilia for the whole world to see.

### The Art of Letting Go

While going through the memorabilia, I noticed that my mind had rewritten complete happenings and even erased some of them. What I saw was not what I remembered.

It was strange to go through these boxes. It was as if I was going through someone else’s diary. That life and those memories no longer belonged to me.

Once I realized this, the hurt from the past dissolved. I no longer felt any need for any form of revenge. I was able to just let go of my past and my memories.

This experience brought me to a more mature and graceful idea for Memory Bytes.

_Through a series of 4 pictures, shot in the dark of the night, the viewer follows a woman as she carries a trash bag to a trash container. In the 5th picture, we get to see that the woman threw away her old love letters and other memorabilia from her past._

The shoot was done by night to make it look like the woman is getting rid of something secret.

The woman in the pictures is me.

I wanted to be the model in the pictures because it only seemed right that I would be the one “getting rid of my past.” Also, this gave me the chance to express myself in yet another creative way.

I chose a fancy skirt and high heels because I like the contrast it casts between dressing up and taking out the trash. It also adds a touch of drama to the atmosphere.

The outfit, furthermore, makes it look like the woman is on her way to a party. I wanted to emphasize the ease with which she lets go of her past and hint at her present and future.

_In case you are wondering: the memorabilia was left in the trash container. And, once done with the shoot, I walked with my present and future to a dinner party._
