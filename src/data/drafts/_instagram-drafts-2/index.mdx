In #Singapore, I can wear a gown to a hawker center, and All Stars to a Michelin restaurant–and nobody cares. I can have “street food,” which I love so much, for as little as 3-4 dollars, but I can also have a $25,- cocktail in some of the best bars in the world. 🍹\
Public transport is beyond your wildest efficiency dreams; taxis not terribly expensive. Sidewalks come with artworks. Palm trees pop up in the most unexpected places. And jogging routes weave between architectural giants. 🏙🏃🏻‍♀️🏙\
It’s also summer all year round. People are friendly. And travel opportunities ample. ⛵️\
“Wherever you go, there you are,” Jon Kabat-Zinn writes. And he’s right. No matter how far you travel, no matter where you move, your insecurities and unsolved problems will come along. There’s no escaping you; however, there’s no denying either, that the grass is in fact greener in some places than others. 🍃 #mirhaxSingapore #yoursingapore #exploresingapore

I think we have unintentionally started a dangerously foolish tradition involving 8K runs in the late hot morning sun and breakfasts at Ru Yi Yuan. 🤒🍜 The first time we did this, we were still rather unaware of what it means to run in the humid tropics after 10AM. 🐌🌴 As for today, however, there’s simply no excuse. Well, except for this slurpy bee hoon with that oh-so-fine crispy fried tofu on the side. 🤘🏼 I’m calling it, “The Finishing Line.” #mirhaxSingapore #vegetarianbeehoon #ruyiyuan #uncagestreetfood #singapore #makansutra #hawkerfoodsg #yoursingapore #exploresingapore\

In 2015 I stayed more than 4 months in all kinds of #hotels and holiday homes. This year I’m surely to break that record as by now I’ve already checked-in 3 months. 🛎

With so much roaming around, I can’t help but to wonder what life would be like lived permanently in hotels. With the necessary lifestyle changes made, would I be able to lead a balanced life without a place to call home?

I think of new ways of high-speed travel and people traveling and living temporarily in different places all over the world. I imagine home ownership gone. I imagine lifetime memberships to “hotel-homes,” schools and offices with various plans to suit individual budgets and preferences. 🏠🏡\
And I blame The Jetsons for all of this. #mirhaxSingapore #marinabaysands #singapore #yoursingapore #exploresingapore #mirhaxMBS

Wednesday was a day of grande discoveries. Starting with lunch and the mighty “#kimchijeon”: a Korean poor man’s dish made with sliced “baechu kimchi” (pickled napa cabbage drowned in chili pepper) and flour batter. It’s crispy, somewhat chewy and addictively umami. Leftovers were dry-fried for dinner and accompanied by a cold beer and lots of jump arounds. Which brings me to dessert and discovery no.2: “banana nice cream.” 🍦🍌\
I don’t know how this works, why this works, but this is pretty much my idea of ice cream. Made by freezing 2 ripe, chopped-up bananas and .. wait for it .. blending them. That’s it. One ingredient. Super damn good. Creamy, smooth, yes. If you haven’t tried making this yet, then maybe better don’t. You’ll very likely be wanting to eat it all day long or you might be shamelessly dreaming about it like Mr. G did. 😴

With a kimchi pancake and magic ice cream in the pocket, I was ready to call it at a night, when just before the clock stroke midnight, I got myself introduced to the mesmerizing aerial coastal shots by [@tommy.clarke](https://www.instagram.com/tommy.clarke/) (🎩tip to [@lostguides](https://www.instagram.com/lostguides/)). That’s three ridiculously awesome discoveries in 1 day. And the amazing world we live in.. ✌🏼#mirhaxSingapore #kimchipancake #wangdaebak #singapore #koreanfood

Steamed rice cakes (“Chwee Kueh”) with crispy preserved radish (“Chye Poh”) and chili oil. The rice cakes are delicate and soft while the spicy and soaking oily toppings elevate the entire dish to a whole other level of robustness. Introduced to me by a local food hero and philosopher of life, Calvin ([@mrpaokaliao](https://www.instagram.com/mrpaokaliao/)). 🤓🍴\
There’s nothing like going for food with locals. Especially here in Singapore where the options are overwhelming. There are more than 15.000 food stalls in 107 hawker centers alone. You could easily spend a year in one of those places trying a different dish every day. 🌶🍤🍚\
Also, chances are you’d never try a dish like chwee kueh on your own, let alone a decent one. Having traditional dishes at the right places can mean the difference between thinking “I guess this is one of those things you must grow up with” and “Wauw! This is special!.” 💥#mirhaxSingapore #chweekueh #uncagestreetfood #tiongbahrumarket #singapore #makansutra #hawkerfoodsg #yoursingapore #exploresingapore\
P.S. While looking up the name of this dish, I stumbled upon the website www\.tiongbahru.market. It’s a super cool directory (reminds me of a computer game) to all the stalls at Tiong Bahru Market. Note the signs of the horn 🤘🏼 that mark the must-try dishes. And if you still can’t decide what to have, let the “food generator” pick for you.\

This week it finally hit me: these shiny skyscrapers are my new home. And a little sooner than I had hoped for, “le culture shock” paid me a visit too. Perhaps though, it would be more fair to call it “my tireless impatience.” As it turns out, trying to settle in a matter of a couple of weeks is hard. 😫 After 2,5 weeks in Singapore, I “still” don’t have a dentist, doctor or new best friend. I also “still” lack the orientation to know which subway exits to take. And I “still” have no idea where to buy everything and nothing or where to get my legs waxed. Imagine the terror. ⚡️ #demandingmuch #mirhaxSingapore #singapore #yoursingapore #explore #singapore

As the plane climbed into the midnight blue, my heart fell into my stomach and 27 days of traveling unfolded before my eyes. It was all there: heroes and villains, humbleness and pride, misfortunes which never happened and adventures of a lifetime. 🛫✨ Soon these memories would be reduced to an incomplete flash. Never again would I understand what I had feared so much. 🕷 I pulled my hoodie over my head, wrapped myself in blankets, and within the sound of earplug-silence, I rested and closed my eyes. A vision of Mr. G slowly crept in, and in that dimmed, overnight-flight darkness, my eyes filled with tears and my thoughts whispered: I did it, boy. I did it. #spinoff9traveler #mirhaxSingapore #singapore\

When I visited India more than 5 years ago, I fell head over heels with the country. And if it wasn’t for the recurring and soul-shattering reports of sexual violence against women, I most certainly would’ve done my travel spin-off there. It saddens me to think that I may never visit this extraordinary country again, and that instead I’ll be bound, as if in some sort of exile, to wistfully roam the Little Indias of the world. #spinoff9more #mirhaxSingapore #littleindia #singapore\
“There are some parts of the world that, once visited, get into your heart and won’t go. For me, India is such a place. When I first visited, I was stunned by the richness of the land, by its lush beauty and exotic architecture, by its ability to overload the senses with the pure, concentrated intensity of its colors, smells, tastes, and sounds. It was as if all my life I had been seeing the world in black and white and, when brought face-to-face with India, experienced everything re-rendered in brilliant Technicolor.” –Keith Bellows, former editor-in-chief of National Geographic Traveler\

I tried to convince the pool lady to let me snap a picture from up there, from where those palm trees sway (do zoom in), looking to capture the famous Marina Bay Sands infinity pool and accompanying view, but she bluntly refused, insisting that only hotel guests have access to the swimming pool. And she was right of course, to follow the rules, and to not let me it. But right there and then, I remember feeling confused and even annoyed with the situation. It was something of a culture shock: people not being willing to break rules. 👮🏽 #spinoff9more #mirhaxSingapore #marinabay #singapore #mirhaxMBS\

While standing at Marina Bay I saw a floating stadium, a giant ferris wheel, a building that looks like a lotus flower, sailboats cruising about, rows of palm trees perched more than 100 meters above ground and a stand up paddle pool in the midst of shiny skyscrapers. I also saw people jogging, cycling, taking photography classes and unwinding at perfectly positioned waterfront bars and restaurants. It was a playful scene which made me wonder if the government of Singapore is not-so-secretly trying to turn the city into an urban playground, making it impossible for anyone who lives here to ever want to leave. 🌴 #spinoff9more #mirhaxSingapore #SEAgames2015 #marinabay #singapore\

I switched between my to-see list and Google Maps, contemplating the data and my emotions. I had just checked-off Chinatown and couldn’t recall much more about the place than that there had been Wi-Fi on the streets. I was disengaged—oblivious to my surroundings. Tomorrow, I’d be going home. In my mind, I was already there. ✈️🏠 To continue sightseeing would be pointless: I wasn’t looking anymore. I put my phone away and started to walk, sine list, sine map, for the sake of walking, for the sake of wasting time. I let the urban landscape lead me, following anything that caught my attention, like that red brick stairway with wooden handrails, and just like that, I found myself exploring again. 🔎 The stairs took me up to a walkway, above a back alley of shophouses and air-conditioning units and through a hilly city garden with nutmeg, cinnamon and tamarind trees. I threaded slowly through what looked like a forgotten path, admiring every next step into my accidental discovery, seemingly far away from the known, when all of sudden, right in front of me, a familiar sight arose. It was the financial district’s skyline, a very-well “known,” a blue horizon towards which I had been gravitating ever since my arrival in Singapore. 🏙🏙 I laughed at the odds, pulled up Google Maps again, and just like that, my mind went back to the arrival hall, back to his embrace while my body continued in the direction of the skyscrapers, fed itself on fish head curry in Little India, met with my host for an iced lemongrass tea and watched two outrageously stupid movies before calling it a day. #spinoff9traveler #mirhaxSingapore #annsianghillpark #singapore\

I looked across the madness in search for that “pinch,” a reality check, and caught MK’s eyes. He seemed as dazzled as I was. Only a few hours ago, it was just the two of us, having a couple of drinks, staring into the Singapore skyline—doing nothing wild. But then the crazy backpacker in me decided to pull me back into travel modus and I started talking to everyone. Soon, MK and I were cracking jokes and busting moves with a 10 pax crew and a fluctuating number of bystanders. We were at rooftop bar 1-Altitude, standing 282 meters above ground, celebrating fearlessness and ad hoc friendships—the best rewards of travel, I knew now. 🍾 #spinoff9traveler #mirhaxSingapore #1altitudebar #singapore ⭐️Travel day 25/30 – Part 2.

Singapore is packed with parks, botanic gardens, nature reserves and many other green spaces. The city’s road sides are lined with beautiful mature trees and lush greenery is crammed into the most unusual places. I’d often see a tree in the corner of my eyes, only to look up and find entire parks in the sky, green-wrapped facades and treehouses hiding in plain sight. 🌳🌳 #metropolitanjungle #spinoff9more #mirhaxSingapore #gardencity #orchardroad #singapore\

Did you know that Singapore is the most expensive country in the world to buy and own a car? Does this piece of information mean nothing to you without cold, hard numbers? Do you hate it as much as I do when people share did-you-know facts sin facts? Well, I already thought so. And that’s why, I guess, I spent an X number of hours cracking the somewhat complex Singaporean car costs code without any intention of ever buying a car in Singapore. 🤓 Now, here’s what I found out: say you want to buy the world’s bestselling car of 2015, which according to a quick Google search happens to be a Toyota Corolla, and you want to owe it in Singapore, then you have to be prepared to cough up a modest $70.000 (source: onemotoring.com.sg). Compare that number to the manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $17.000 (source: toyota.com) and you might now understand why I was walking in Singapore like: “Where the jams at?.” 🚗🚗🚗 The reason why it’s so expensive to buy a car in Singapore is because the government has come up with an extensive tax structure in an attempt to limit the growth of vehicles on the roads. This tax structure mainly includes the following big boys: Excise Duty (20% of Open Market Value of the vehicle); a Certificate of Entitlement which gives you the right to own a vehicle and to use the roads for 10 years and which can only be obtained through competitive bidding (price depends on demand but at the moment it’s around $40.000); and The Additional Registration Fee (calculated based on a percentage of the Open Market Value of the vehicle: 100% for first $14.000, 140% for next $20.000 and 180% above $35.000). And while you’re busy recalculating, don’t forget to add the road tax and car insurance. 💰💰 Well, that’s that for shattering your dreams of ever owning a car in Singapore, but hey, at least you now have a great conversation starter for the next time you find yourself carpooling or watching an F1 race. By the way, is it just me or do you also feel like watching Top Gear now? #whosayswomendonttalkcar #didyouknow #cartalk #spinoff9more #mirhaxSingapore #orchardroad #singapore

If yesterday was about brushing off the travellers dirt and easing into the mundane, then today was all about completing the makeover and slipping right back into day-to-day life. After three weeks on the road, I was longing for routine and everyday tasks: meditating, making breakfast, going to the gym, sitting down to write a post—I had missed it all. Even the chores, which back home make me want to jump on the next plane, seemed now rather enjoyable experiences. Folding my laundry and doing groceries fell no less fulfilling than discovering a secluded beach or diving with Nemo. I knew it wouldn’t last; I just needed this morning. 🏋🏻 🍳 💻 The rest of the day I spent doing not much more than mall hopping and blending with the crowd. Singapore treated me like that rare friend who knows when to leave you alone and when to offer soothing care and advice. It allowed me to be anonymous, and yet, I never felt alone. 💫 I was being engulfed in a cloud of kindness. People were nice. And they all seemed to think I’d be back sooner than I could promise. The beautician insisted that I took part in their stamp saving program for free future treatments. The hairdresser gave me enough restaurant recommendations to last a month. And the girl at the metro, who had stopped to ask if I needed help figuring out my route, urged me to stop buying standard travel tickets and to instead get a “top-up card” for non-tourists. 🔮 The day went by quickly like only routine-based days know how to, and without a warning, the evening fell. I innocently added yet another auditioning day for Desperate Housewives to my résumé, not knowing that my inner backpacker was planning a comeback. #spinoff9traveler #mirhaxSingapore #paragonorchard #singapore ⭐️ Travel day 25/30 – Part 1.\

I grab my backpack from the luggage compartment, determined, as if I just got out at my usual bus stop, and start walking like I know where I’m going. But I don’t, exactly. Actually, I’ve never been here before. Nevertheless, my route proves straightforward, oddly affirming this false sense of familiarity. One inquiry into my whereabouts plus two underground connections later and I’m only three blocks away from where I need to be. 🕳 I don’t have much time to contemplate my environment, but I can see at once that, yes indeed, the streets here are exceptionally clean. Some people seem to frown upon this reality, like grouchy Europeans do about the table service in The States, arguing it’s “too much” and fake. I don’t get that. If you ask me, both are exactly like they should be: plain amazing. 👌🏻 Speaking of first impressions, I’m loving the absence of culture shock. People understand me. Surroundings look familiar. Nobody is bothering me. Nobody even seems to see me. Oh! I keep meaning to tell you; I’m in Singapore. \[Story continues in comments below👇🏻 ] #spinoff9traveler #mirhaxSingapore #boatquay #singapore\

After a couple of weeks of hardcore travelling, going all over Northeastern Thailand, we felt like we had enough sights, temples and nature parks under the belt. 🌳 So after seeing the impressive Phanom Rung temple, we decided to scratch everything else on the to-see list, got in the car and made the 8h-drive from Buriram to Hua Hin–arriving just in time for sunset. 💫 #relaxationmodeison #huahin #thailand #mirhaxthailand

Loved the pitstop at Kaeng Kut Khu where plenty of locals where enjoying a welcome breeze and pretty Mekong views allover. 👌🏻 We feasted on deep-fried whole fish with garlic, ginger and chillies, a stupyfying spicy papaya salad, a snack called กุ้งฝอยแพทอด (no idea what the latin alphabet equivalent would be, but it’s crispy fried shrimps in the form of a frisbee) and sealed the lot with a cold beer. 🍻 All while everyone in the riverside restaurant kept looking to see what we had ordered and was not-so-secretly making selfies with us in the background. 😂 On our way back to the car Mr. G bought us a little betle nut snack called #miengkham (betle nut leaf smeared with tamarind sauce, sprinkled with chopped peanuts and stuffed with tiny cubes of lime and ginger, thin slices of chili and red onion, toasted coconut and tiny dried shrimp) which was positively explosive and threw me right back to India where they have something similar called #paan.

The restaurant I mentioned in the previous post would be reason enough for me to visit Bueang Kan province. 😁 But, if that’s not the case for you, then Wat Phu Tok (do Google it) with it’s “network of rickety staircases and walkways built in, on and around a giant sandstone outcrop” should be. ✨ Allow the Lonely Planet to convince you a little more: “The precarious paths lead past shrines that are scattered around the mountain on cliffs and in caves, and provide fabulous views over the surrounding countryside. A final scramble up roots and rocks takes you to the forest on the summit, which is considered the seventh level.” Very likely the highlight of our travels in Thailand. 🍃 #watphutok #buengkan #buengkanprovince #thailand #mirhaxthailand

There’s not much going on in Bueang Kan city, except for the best Thai restaurant I’ve eaten at in my life. The food at “Dang Moh” is absolutely fantastic. 😋 We indulged in steamed snapper which cooked right in front of our eyes in a spicy broth with layers of lemon grass, kaffir limes, garlic, ginger and chillies. 🐟 Super fragrant and delicious! But the biggest surprise was undoubtedly this deep-fried chicken with crispy kaffir limes (!!). A house speciality which will surely haunt me in my dreams for a long time to come.🔥 #dangmohrestaurant #buengkan #buengkanprovince #thailand #aroi #mirhaxthailand

Admiring the stunning mountainhills of Laos from mellow Nakhon Phanom city. 🔭 Mr. G and I contemplated staying the night but decided after a long walk to keep driving to Bueng Kan. One of my favorite things about roadtripping is that you can decide on the fly if you wanna stay somewhere or pack up and go. 🚗 Some others things I love about travelling by car, is that you get to see so much of the beautiful surroundings, and of course, the singing and silliness with Mr. G. 🙈 #nakhonphanom #nakhonphanomprovince #thailand #mirhaxthailand

It was high time to put my recently attained rock climbing skills into practice (see #whenmirhagotshaky). Thinking of which, San Francisco, I do miss you. ✨ Also, this was apparently a filming location for the movie “Alexander.” Furthermore, in this pic you can see the cliff Pha Taem, the Mekong River and Laos. 🔎 And, if you’re travelling to Thailand soon, definitely consider making the trip to Pha Taem National Park. The 2h walking trail around the cliff is definitely worth it. 🗿 There are also plenty of waterfalls to explore (now mostly dried up) and wildflowers to sniff at (now still not). 🌿 Two last things: 1. That Kim Kardashian effect you see, is just that, an effect. And, 2., I lost this skirt one hour ago on the road when I put it on the roof of the car to dry and forgot all about it. 🍻 #phataemnationalpark #ubonratchathaniprovince #thailand #dametraveler #mirhaxthailand

Taking the decision to radically change our travel plans and rent a car for the remaining days of our trip was frankly a bit scary. What if the grass wasn’t greener on the other side? 🌾 But we couldn´t be happier. It was absolutely the right decision. The nature here in Northeastern Thailand is stunning. The people are mellow, and travelling in low season, to a normally already quiet part of Thailand, means we have all the sights to ourselves. Like these too-cool-for-school mushroom-shaped stone formations, known as Sao Chaliang, in Pha Taem National Park. 🍄 #wheresmario #saochaliang #phataemnationalpark #ubonratchathaniprovince #thailand #mirhaxthailand

Fed up with the crowds in Chiang Mai, and unimpressed with the surroundings, Mr. G and I decided to turn our travel itinerary upside down. 🌏 We were no longer going to follow the often-taken route deeper into northern Thailand, but were instead, renting a car and going to explore the much-less visited northeast of Thailand. 🚗 Two domestic flights later, we picked up our rental, and drove to Ubon Ratchatani (main city). What a difference.. this is what travel dreams are made of. ✨ And, on a less cheesy note, there’s something rather cool when you turn out to be the main tourist attraction. 😂 #watsiubonrattanaram #ubonratchathani #ubonratchathaniprovince #thailand #mirhaxthailand

Rented a muppet in Chiang Mai and went up to the peaks of Doi Suthep and Doi Pui. 🗻 Our bike wasn’t all that powerful, and besides having to tank two times on our way up, I even had to step off and walk up in the turns. No more sticky rice with mango for me. 🙈 Besides visiting the Hmong village (in previous 2 pics), we also stopped at Doi Suthep-Pui National Park which looked like the place for spooky storytelling and serious marshmallow roasting (both of which I’ve never done). 👻 On our way back down, we visited Wat Phra Doi Suthep. An impressive temple, but with pretty rad dragon stairs. 🐉 As for everyone who paid to take selfies with the little kids in (fake) traditional clothing, shame on you. 😤 #watphrathatdoisuthep #chiangmaiprovince #thailand #mirhaxthailand

Hmon village Ban Doi Pui is described as “basically a tourist market at altitude” in the Lonely Planet. 😕 But after taking a random turn, we found ourselves strolling up and down tiny alleys, while peeking into people’s houses and seeing everyday life pass by beyond the business. It was glorious. ✨ I couldn’t help but to wonder if Lonely Planet ever set foot here–and in many other “recommended” places for that matter. Ah, how much I love and hate that guide at the same time. ✌🏻️ #hmonvillage #bandoipui #chiangmaiprovince #thailand #mirhaxthailand

You might not, like ignorant me, myself and I, expect this .. but Thailand is surprisingly #hipster. 😎 I’ve seen many cool artisan coffee shops and modern outdoor dining areas like the Ploen Rudee Night Market in Chiang Mai (close to the famous Night Bazaar) which is positively crowded with hip food trucks, hay stacks and this awesome cocktail tuk tuk bar. 🌵 Oddly reminds me of that movie with Tom Cruise which I’ve never seen.

I really enjoy using the Google Maps application to find my way when travelling. 📱 Some hardcore travellers will argue that this is somehow cheating. That it doesn’t allow for the art of getting lost. But I find the opposite to be true. When using Google Maps, I can let go on my way from A to B, and enjoy the surroundings without constantly having to ask for directions or having to be concerned about being “on the right way.” 🏁 I take as many lefts and rights as I want because I know that once I’m done getting lost, Google Maps will get me to my initial destination anyhow. Moreover, the app doesn’t seem to care much for touristic routes. That’s how I all of suddenly found myself standing on railways somewhere in a random part of Bangkok. 🚂 #priceless #bangkok #thailand #mirhaxbangkok

This was one of those travel days when everything that could’ve gone wrong, went wrong. ⚡️ And just when we realized this, a little late, at the end of the day, we decided to buy a couple of beers at a random 7 Eleven and to just stop fighting it. ⛅️ Walking down the streets of Bangkok, cheering and laughing, and provoking more bad luck, we finally arrived at Octave Rooftop Bar & Lounge. Here we lived happily ever after with this stupefying view, top-class waiters, 2 for 1 cocktails and the best lounging tunes I’ve heard in a long time. 🍹 #truestory #rooftopbar #octavebkk #bangkok #thailand #mirhaxbangkok

The other day I woke up with the idea of inviting Mr. G to a fine dining experience in Thailand. While he was still sleeping, I called restaurant Nahm and with a stroke of luck managed to make a reservation for lunch. 🍴 Nahm is considered to be one of the best restaurants in Bangkok. It was voted the prestigious World’s Best Restaurants (no.13) and Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants (no.1) in 2014. So you might imagine my excitement. 😎 We went for the set menu and this way ended up having an elaborate tasting of many different dishes. 🍚🍚 Too many to share here, though this might give you an idea: blue swimmer crab with peanuts and pickled garlic on rice cakes, salad of fresh river prawns with pork and Asian pennywort, minced chicken curry with yellow eggplants and shampoo ginger and sweet Thai wafers with poached permissions and golden duck egg noodles. Think I’ll leave it at that .. 🍸 #nahm #comohotels #metbangkok #bangkok #thailand #mirhaxbangkok

Here’s the long answer: stir-fried rice noodles with eggs, tofu, bean sprouts, tamarind pulp, fish sauce, dried shrimps, garlic, red chilis and palm sugar served with lime wedges, chopped roast peanuts, chives and raw banana flowers. 😋 And, the short answer: I should’ve ordered two. 🍤🍤 #ผัดไทย #padthai #bangkok #thailand #mirhaxbangkok

It’s come to my attention that Europeans (the few I’ve talked to 😁) aren’t so excited about Asian capitals. I’m almost always advised to flee the main cities as soon as I can. 🚀 But I, frankly, always fall head over heels with the big cities. Places like Mumbai and Bangkok are some of the coolest playgrounds I can imagine. 🎳 Speaking of which, in this beautiful hidden courtyard, in the midst of the bustle of Chinatown, these men were playing “sepak takraw.” 👉🏻 Or, translated, kick volleyball. The point of this game is to hold a rattan ball up in the air as gracefully as possible, using your head, chest, knees or feet. 🔥 Oh, and this girl on the bike (holding the steer with only one hand) had her little sister on the back. Yeah, kids grow up to be that cool here. ✨ #cansomeonetranslatethechinese #bangkok #thailand #nevernottraveling #mirhaxbangkok

K. asked me a couple of days ago to share my 10 favorite foods with y’all. 🍴 And I decided to totally deconstruct this question and give 2 answers plus cheat the hell out of the limit of picking only 10 foods. 🙈 My absolute favorites are Indian and Thai Curries (1 + 2) and noodle soups (3). 🍜 You can also wake me up for an awesome pasta (4) or ridiculously good hamburger (5). 🍔 I love sugarless treats and cakes like something very nutty or chocolaty (6). 🍫 I am sucker for healthy breakfast smoothies (7). Big fan of eggs (8), hearty breakfasts (9), complex salads (10), roasted meats (11), grilled fish (12) and sushi (13). 🍳 And yes, also, ice cream (14). This particular one ☝️ is from [@HumphrySlocombe](https://www.instagram.com/HumphrySlocombe/) made with olive oil and topped with balsamic vinegar. No need to tell you how freaking fantastic that tasted, do I? 😋 Moving on to answer no.2. If this is about healthy breakfast ingredients (and I actually think it is), I’d say: 1. everything coconut (milk, cream, the fresh stuff itself), 2. avocado, 3. powders like raw cacao, 4. maca and 5. matcha, 6. crunchy peanut butter, 7. ginger, 8. eggs, 9. spinach, 10. mint, 11. basil and 12. strawberries. 🍓So, yeah, might have kinda cheated my way through this one, but well, there you go! I’d like to pass this share on to [@theguidetogood](https://www.instagram.com/theguidetogood/) (check out his amazing photos from his current eats and travels through India and Myanmar) and to my dearest friend [@arjencalter](https://www.instagram.com/arjencalter/) (photographer, life coach and sucker for healthy food).

A regular added though that there might be some crack involved too. 😎 Sounds plausible. And it would definitely explain a lot. Like, for example, why I’m drinking coffee.

One of the highlights of going to The Coit Tower was taking a walk around the mural rontanda. I loved taking the time to appreciate the frescos and the stories behind these works. 🎨 The artists who did the paintings committed to racial equality and leftist political ideas which they also expressed in their works. ✌️ These frescos were considered quite controversial and provocative in their time. One of them was even destroyed. Standing here made me, besides inspired, somewhat sad and angry, because I realized that after all these centuries, we still live in such racist world which is ruled by plenty of censorship. 😶 It breaks my heart every time I realize that there are so many people on this world who aren’t able to live life as they please. It’s unbelievable, really. 🌍 #mirhaxSanFrancisco #imagine

Look at the mountains of cheese slices the men of Molinari prepared for the lunch crowds. 😋 Such a cool store with an abundance of great Italian products. 🇮🇹 Made me wish I lived in SF. I picked up a salami sandwich to enjoy later on al fresco. I also stopped for a cappuccino at Caffe Trieste in the same area (not in picture). ☕️ I usually don’t drink coffee, but I had to have a cup of the black gold here. Though they supposedly serve the best coffee in the city, what actually drew me in is that Ford Coppola drafted his script of The Godfather in Caffe Trieste. 🔫 Pretty awesome. Needless to say that I’m having a blast in San Francisco. 💣#mirhaxSanFrancisco #italianfood #molinari #northbeach #sanfrancisco #california #USA #travel #nevernoteating #nevernottraveling #blogger

Took the car to the garlic capitol of the world, Gilroy. 🚗 Unfortunately, I found downtown in pretty poor shape and was quickly done walking around. 👣 Trying to make the best of the 1h drive that it took me to get to Gilroy, I decided to go to the Gilroy museum. Though it was as equally depressing as the rest of Gilroy, I kinda did get into it after a while. And, learning how toy bears came to be named teddy bears, made me oddly happy. 🐻 I then went for this super nice gluten-free carrot cake cupcake and a delicious pot of chamomile, ginger and lemon tea at [@pattisperfectpantry](https://www.instagram.com/pattisperfectpantry/). 🍵 This was quite pleasant, really. I finished my excursion with a drive through Gilroy’s vineyards. The vistas and peeks into the huge villas along the way, including my previous high tea time and newly obtained toy knowledge, made the trip, in the end, something to be grateful for anyhow. 🎈 #mirhaxCalifornia #smallthings #cupcake #carrotcake #pattisperfectpantry #gilroy #california #usa #travel #nevernottraveling #blogger #glutenfree #sweet #cake #healthy #roadtrip #america #wanderlust #bucketlist #visting #cool #beautiful #trip #tourism #tourist #traveling #holiday #awesome #instatravel #passportready

Ended the wine tasting trip through #Sonoma with this beautiful view at Gundlach Bundschu. 🌳 The ambient was the only good thing about this winery though, as their wine and service was utterly terrible. 😝 However, I didn’t care whatsoever because our first wine tasting experience at Loxton Cellars was magnificent. I’ve drank a lot of wine in my life. More than is good for me, for sure. 😇 And, all though I wouldn’t say I am an expert of any kind, Loxton wines are out of this world.👌 Incredibly special and nothing like I’ve ever had before. I took only one little bottle of pure Zinfadel gold with me, (2012, Sonoma Hillside Vineyards) but if I could’ve, I would’ve taken it all. 📦📦 My heart already aches for having to part with this elixir of life too soon. Note to self: make American friends. 👦 👧 Let me know if you’d like to know what other Loxton wines I thought were awesome. 🍷 #mirhaxCalifornia #wine #winery #winetasting #gundlachbundschu #loxtoncellars #california #usa #travel #nevernottraveling #blogger

Stopped at Juanita Juanita to fuel up before going wine tasting. ⛽️This is the Tostada Regular: a crispy flour shell, filled with carne asada (grilled steak), avocado, beans, lettuce, salsa and sour cream, and topped with cotija cheese and cumin vinaigrette.💃 Pretty spot on and a welcome break from all the carb binging. Mexican food, by the way, is perfect for followers of the [@timferriss](https://www.instagram.com/timferriss/) #4hourbody slow-carb lifestyle (don’t eat the shell) and also ticks most boxes for [@iquitsugar](https://www.instagram.com/iquitsugar/) dudes and babes. Just saying. 💪 Furthermore, I can also recommend the garlicky burrito with chicken, and from what I could tell by looking at other customers, the tortilla soup seems to be the main gig. Oh!!

Ended the day close to home in the vibrant city of Campbell. 🏁 Where I had plenty more carbs in the form of my first deep dish #pizza at Blue Line Pizza ([@bluelinepizza](https://www.instagram.com/bluelinepizza/)).🍕 Ordered the small one, half Blue Line (spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onion, garlic) and half Meatball (spicy homemade meatballs, ricotta, spinach, mushrooms, red bells) and shared it with Mr. G. 👨. It was more than enough and I liked it quite a bit. Coolest thing ever is that the dish, besides being a pizza, is also a dessert. 😳 The waitress gave us a bottle of honey and told us to use it once we reached the cornbread crust. So, you’re like eating bites of pizza, pizza, pizza and then cornbread with honey. And again, pizza, pizza, pizza, cornbread and honey. Seriously. All dreams come true in The States. 🍻 #mirhaxCalifornia #neverleaving #breakingalldiets #beatthis #bluelinepizza #campbell #usa #california #delicious #food #travel #nevernottraveling #blogger

After visiting the town of Half Moon Bay, we took highway 1, passing overwhelming fields of yellow flowers, to the end of Pillar Point Harbor. ⚓️ There I hoped to see Mavericks, an impressive surf break that attracts the world’s biggest big-wave riders. 🏄Unfortunately, the surf was completely down and the surfers were floating around some. 😴Nonetheless, I loved being at the beach again.

If I am supposed to believe these mailboxes, then there are apparently people living somewhere in these remote woods. Must be practically slightly unhandy, though manageable, I guess. And spiritually, it must be freaking awesome. To get here from San Jose, we took the Big Basin Way/Highway 9, through beautiful Saratoga, all the way to Big Basin Redwoods State Park. Truly a gorgeous route with almost nobody on the road, lots of quirky turns for the F1 lovers (and bikers), and nature everywhere. Took us a bit more than an hour. On our way back to San Jose, we took the Big Basin Way to the other side (connecting to Bear Creek Rd), but it wasn’t as nearly as scenic as the first route. #mirhaxCalifornia #youvegotmail #americanicon #americanlife #hobbiton #redwoods #nature #travel #roadtrip #bigbasinway #highway9 #bigbasinredwoodsstatepark #california #theusa #thestates #america

While Mr. G would be at his training for work, I would be exploring the beautiful cities and towns of Silicon Valley. This was the first time in my life that I “travelled” alone. On one hand, it was adventurous and empowering. On the other hand, talking to myself all the time made me feel pretty nuts. Is this something you, as a solo traveller, can recognize?

Kadhai Bhindi (okra w/ onion, tomato, bell pepper and spices) and Gosht Malabar (Southern Indian style lamb simmered in coconut milk, curry leaf and whole chilies gravy). Damn good! Accompany these dishes with a little bit of naan bread, some rice and cool the whole lot down with a cold Kingfisher. A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. Finish the evening with a stroll on your spice high through the lovely Castro Street and stop at number 241B (Gelato Classico) for what may have been the best ice cream I have ever had.
