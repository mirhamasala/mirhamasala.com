Born in [Sarajevo](http://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mirhaxSarajevo/), Bosnia and Herzegovina. Grown in Delft, The Netherlands.

Fled the small Dutch town as soon as I reached the age of 18 and moved to glorious Amsterdam for European Studies and parties.

Pursued a career in foreign affairs but then dropped the dream when I found out only aliens work in politics.

Needed a new dream/career/lifestyle, so decided to try out 12 different ones in 1 year and travel the world.

[Mr.G](http://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mirhaxG/) suggested I publish this outrageous undertaking online, and I thought, “Why not?”

Set up thespinoffproject.com and in the process fell in love with blogging.

Visited more than 20 countries, lived in some, and tried [12 different lifestyles](http://www.thespinoffproject.com/category/spinoffs/) in the last six years.

Been a [polyglot](/tsop/posts/polyglot-month/), [artist](/tsop/posts/artist-month/), [kiteboarder](/tsop/posts/kiteboarder-month/), [philanthropist](/tsop/posts/philanthropist-month/), [dancer](/tsop/posts/dancer-month/), [entrepreneur](/tsop/posts/entrepreneur-month/), [reader](/tsop/posts/reader-month/), [snowboarder](/tsop/posts/snowboarder-month/), [traveler](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/spinoff9traveler/), [meditator](/tsop/posts/meditator-month/), [surfer](/tsop/posts/surfer-month/) and [photographer](/tsop/posts/photographer-month/).

Now in [Singapore](http://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mirhaxsingapore), checking off my [bucket list](/tsop/posts/bucket-list/#list) and learning to code.
