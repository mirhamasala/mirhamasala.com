Hi All,

**I hope you’re doing well**. ❤️

Recently, I received a job offer. The company in question asked me to become their front-end lead. I told them I couldn’t do that. Twice.

Before this company, there were others. And I had given them all the same answer––Thank you, but no.

On my first job as a dev, I was made the front lead in the first week. And in that same week, I discovered we were charging our customer a dizzying amount for a day’s worth of my work. I was three months out of my coding bootcamp, and I kept trying to convince everyone a mistake had been made.

It seemed nobody was getting the memo that I wasn’t qualified.

Then after declining that recent offer, I woke up the next day, thinking that it was perhaps me who didn’t get the memo now.

I was disqualifying myself from the start and had begun saying ‘No’ out of habit.

But how ready would I need to be to say ‘Yes?’

And what if I just stopped saying ‘No,’ and instead worked hard to prove everyone right?

What if _you_ did the same?

## Words

I added five more titles to [Read 100 (Business) Books](/posts/read-100-books/#finished-reads), including my favorite quotes, takeaways, and a cheeky fact here and there.

- [_Keep Going_](/posts/read-100-books/#keep-going) – Austin Kleon
- [_The Tipping Point_](/posts/read-100-books/#the-tipping-point) – Malcolm Gladwell
- [_Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous_](/posts/read-100-books/#learn-enough-git-to-be-dangerous) – Michael Hartl
- [_Pitch Perfect_](/posts/read-100-books/#pitch-perfect) – Haje Jan Kamps
- [_Competing Against Luck_](/posts/read-100-books/#competing-against-luck) – Clayton M. Christensen

## Poem That’s On My Mind

While thinking of sharing this poem with you, I had the feeling that I might’ve shared it before. It turns out I did. I shared it [when I was about to go on training for that very first dev job](/letters/0818/). How curious is that? It’s like a rhyme that reappears for the major milestones of my new career. Perhaps it can be yours too.

There is freedom waiting for you,\
On the breezes of the sky,\
And you ask “What if I fall?”\
Oh but my darling, What if you fly?

–Erin Hanson
