I watched G watch Singapore for the first time, holding my breath more often than taking it. I had been to Singapore once, and yet based on that 3-day trip alone, _we_ had decided to move. But it wasn’t until now that the thought G may not like the place flooded me with worry.

To my advantage, the taxi driver had taken the scenic route, and as we came down from the palm-tree-lined airport road, Marina Bay appeared in all her nightly glory. I saw the corners of G’s mouth turn up, and in his eyes, the glow of the bay intensified.

G and I told our family and friends we’d stay in Singapore a year at most, but the city-state turned out to make for a comfortable home, and so we stayed five.

As a foreign professional coming to Singapore, life is likely to feel like an upgrade. You’ll probably reside in a lush condo with a gym, swimming pool, and entertaining areas, and if you’re an expat with a family, a domestic helper to take care of your home and kids.

Besides these privileges, the taxes are low, the crime rate still lower, healthcare options abundant, and most people understand English, as does the paperwork, which is often digital and a breeze to get done.

Furthermore, the public transport is excellent, taxies are cheap, and the city is clean and green, dotted with artworks and tropical plants and trees, which at times pop up from unexpected corners.

Also, it’s always summer, with the lows seldom dipping under 25°C. And if you want to escape the dot, that’s smooth too, with plenty of travel options to neighboring countries. Plus, I’m sure you’ve already heard everything about Changi airport.

Lastly, Singapore’s chart of greatest hits wouldn’t be complete without mentioning the city’s food choices, ranging from Michelin-awarded hawker stalls to Michelin-starred restaurants in every cuisine you can imagine. And, if you’re more into cooking, you can have your groceries delivered to your doorstep with the help of a few apps (including organic produce and grass-fed-anything from Australia and New Zealand).

Thus, with all these everyday comforts, you may see how G and I could’ve easily stayed in Singapore for years to come. That is, had it not been for the virus.

Although I don’t think there was a better place than Singapore [to get used to the new reality of our world](/letters/paper-planes-packets-1120/), after 438 days without leaving the city-state, some of its inconveniences and ugly sides magnified and ultimately made me wish to move on.

Some annoyances, like the lack of silence and nature, were simply the realities of living in any city, but which before Covid-19, I remedied by traveling half of the time outside of Singapore.

Other concerns were more inherent to Singapore, like how dirty the public spaces became once foreign workers couldn’t enter and clean up after its citizens.[^1]

Also, on top of the already heavy state surveillance, the state decided to make the data from the Covid-19 tracing app available to the police to trace crime, even though they first said the data would be private.[^2]<sup>|</sup>[^3]

Then there was the now-undeniable discrimination against migrant workers (mainly from Bangladesh and India), as the state grounded more than 300.000 workers to their dormitories under the guise of containing the virus outbreak, while everyone else was free to continue life as usual. [^4]<sup>|</sup>[^5]

As time passed, I became increasingly more nostalgic about the freedom to express oneself, love who you want, and make mistakes, in contrast to Singapore’s somber realities of censorship, anti-gay laws, and corporal and capital punishments.

Yet, this is in no way an easy goodbye. Singapore has been the backdrop to five of the most important years of my life, and I’ll remember it with warmth.

In Singapore, I finished [The Spin-Off Project](/tsop), started this blog, and found my first two jobs as a [web developer](/posts/leap-of-code/).

G and I married in [Fort Canning](#fort-canning). And I got the idea for [The Knitting Club](/posts/the-knitting-club/) on the F1 tarmac.

I ran my first 10K here, the last of the Green Corridor runs, and wore my medal after the race for the entire day. And I learned [to juggle](/dropbox#bucket-list-19-learn-to-juggle-limes), [swim freestyle](/posts/favorite-things-2020#a-skill-i-loved-learning), [do a cartwheel](/dropbox#bucket-list-18-learn-to-do-a-cartwheel), and strict pull-up.

I also joined [the 5 AM club](/posts/favorite-things-2020#a-habit-friends-were-most-curious-about), [started drinking coffee](/posts/favorite-things-2018#the-unexpected-discovery) daily, and overcame [my fear of asking strangers for photos](/tsop/posts/30-days-photography#day-1-moving-away-from-auto-mode).

I went to numerous workshops, including [tea](/posts/favorite-things-2017#tea-side-faves), coffee, kombucha, cooking, and pottery ones. Plus, there was the acting one, leaving me flattered, still, with an offer to produce a one-woman show.

I visited nine new countries from the dot. And I was always happy to come back, racing G through passport control, back to our humbling loft on the fringes of Chinatown and Tanjong Pagar, a serendipitous 5-minute walk from [the peek-through park](#ann-siang-hill-park) that [stole my imagination the first time I visited Singapore](/tsop/posts/30-days-traveling#day-26).

Most importantly, I met the people who make a place. Strangers who became friends and filled my heart with their being and quirkiness—merging speckles of their sameness and otherness with mine, into something else, a dot of a different culture and way, now part of me, and from here with me everywhere.
