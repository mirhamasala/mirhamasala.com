You know how people say, time flies? Well, I don’t feel like that about time at all. I think time goes rather slow. Now whether that’s a depressing or comforting thought, depends on my mood. 😎🤓 Be that as it may, I was surprised to discover that it’s almost been 4 weeks since my trip to New York. While I found my experience of the big apple overpowering and confusing, I knew these feelings would settle in time. And so they did. 🍏 Looking back, awakened from the spell and overwhelm, I’m able to relive those days in the city in a much slower motion. Away from the concrete source, I can now clearly tell the difference between the various neighborhoods and am able to pinpoint my likes. However, curious enough, I don’t seem to have a favorite. Midtown, Greenwich Village, Chelsea, the Meatpacking District, East Village, the Financial District, SoHo, Chinatown (and Brooklyn): I like them all. ⭐️ Until we meet again, New York-New York. ✌🏼 P.S. We found an apartment in Singapore. It’s a gorgeous little loft in my absolute favorite part of the city, right behind a park and food area that I stumbled upon accidently and fell in love with on my previous trip to Singapore. #purewow

The High Line is an elevated greenway built on an obsolete railway in the city of New York. Though the line only (partially) opened in 2009 to the public, it has ever since been irrevocably connected to my images of NYC and my promise to show Mr.G a part of New York he hadn’t seen yet. 👫💫 As we walked the High Line, the urban dreamscape reminded me somewhat of the “Hallen” in Amsterdam. It’s a cultural center for food, film and fashion built on the site of an old tram depot and located only 2 streets away from our house. 🍄 But except for a flashback into a life I was about to leave behind, the High Line also sparked a peek into my future as it made me look forward in discovering the “Green Corridor” in Singapore: a 26 kilometers long trail which takes the route of an old railway and is flanked by jungly trees. 🌴 #connectingthedots

A couple of years ago, I started swapping the glass of wine for a cold #beer. Nowadays I rarely drink the adult grape juice anymore. Though I still love an amazing glass of wine (emphasis on amazing), I do find that it often makes me a little too tipsy, a little too quick. And that unless I’m either in Spain or willing to pay up when out drinking and dining, I’m more often than not gulping down super lousy stuff. ⚗ ☠️ On the other hand, it’s a lot more difficult to end up with super lousy beer. Moreover, as the beer scene has been coming up neatly in the last years, drinking beer is now cooler than ever. In New York, for example, many bars offer a “beer flight” which is a sampling of several beers. I had this particular set at rooftop beer garden, La Birreria. 🍺🍺🍺 On the menu I also found mulled wine and other boozy hot cocktails which one would order after a day on the slopes. In fact, I clearly remember Mr.G and I commenting how great this place would be if it were only snowing outside. I guess we should’ve stuck around for a few more days. 😂🌨 It’s been exactly a week now since Mr.G and I arrived to our new hometown, Singapore. The week passed somewhat in a frenzy. We’ve been ridding ourselves of the jet lag, getting to know the city, eating like pigs, and of course, apartment hunting. Everything is going well. 😊

Pretty much why I always wanted to go to New York is so I could walk around with a (matcha) latte to-go and buy ridiculously expensive chocolate. Well, the later might not have been part of the original daydreaming plan, though very much so the reality. I guess I should know by now that if a shop doesn’t display its prices, I potentially do risk dropping my jaw once I realize I paid more than 40 dollars for less than 200 grams of chocolate. 💸🍫 Speaking of the world gone mad and overpriced goods, I was up in the air, browsing through KLM’s inflight magazine, when I stumbled upon Mont Blanc’s “luxury products”. I really would like a new pen, but now I’m torn between the No.26 “Meisterstück Red Gold Classique Ballpoint Pen” (€275,-) and the No.95 “Princesse Grace de Monaco Ivory Ballpoint Pen” (€510,-). What do you think? 😂😱 #itsapenforcryingoutloud Also, the movers came yesterday and packed Mr.G’s and my personal belongings into 19 parcels. That’s it for our material lives. All wrapped up and shipped off to Singapore. Only 2 more days until we fire ourselves that way. Getting panicky about the lack of panic attacks.

In the weekends I like to invite Mr.G for a cup of coffee in our hood at Lot Sixty One ([@lotsixtyonecoffee](https://www.instagram.com/lotsixtyonecoffee/)). It’s a self-proclaimed tradition and one that I enjoy quite a bit despite almost never ordering coffee for myself (or a very-not-done single shot latte). 😇🍼 Also, whenever we’re traveling, I do my best to mark a few cool coffee spots for G. as to keep up with the ritual (which by the way always ends with G. saying that his favorite is still Lot61 🙉). Anyway, in New York, I brought him to [#Devoción](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/devoci%C3%B3n/) ([@devocionusa](https://www.instagram.com/devocionusa/)) in [#Brooklyn](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/brooklyn/) (kudos to [@meltingbutter](https://www.instagram.com/meltingbutter/) for the 🎩tip). This shot doesn’t show the way-cool space and green wall behind me, but I like the picture because it invites me to imagine the stories behind these buns and hats. I like to zoom in on the different choices of bags, the ways they’re all sitting and how they’ve hung their coats. Their lives existed only for a few minutes in the same space, and yet in this frame, they’re bound together, forever. 💫 On a more insta-ish note: Sunday is the day we move to Singapore. Tomorrow, the movers are coming. And I, still haven’t had a panic attack. 😱 Oddly enough, my days are being quite pleasant. There’s some chaos, but it all seems to be evened out by plenty of last-minute meetups and calls with friends and family. Oh, and before I forget, I had apple pie with [@soakuptheworld](https://www.instagram.com/soakuptheworld/) and [@yulienick](https://www.instagram.com/yulienick/) yesterday, and yes, they made me say this. Just kidding, it’s how I get them to read my posts. 😜 #notagsnofriends

We saved the must-walk over the Brooklyn Bridge for a summer visit and instead took the subway straight to Williamsburg. I had heard so many good things about Brooklyn that I was really curious about the place. I can now understand what people like so much about it. Brooklyn is cool and edgy and yet neighborly cozy (and you don’t have to be looking up all the time like in Manhattan). We spent the entire afternoon and evening walking around and hopping into bars, shops and restaurants. It was nice. 👫🍸🍴 One thing that caught my attention is how quiet the streets were both in Manhattan and Brooklyn. I imagined New York to be a lot more busy. And though I think there was something rather special about visiting New York during this cold winter month, I’m looking forward to come back here in the summer. 🍃 As for a more real-time update, I just Skyped with my parents again. We didn’t catch each other for two weeks and I really began missing our weekly chat. My mom has started learning English, 4 hours a week with a private teacher. I’m so incredibly proud of her for doing this. She also told me she’s now using my posts for practice. Knowing that my mom will soon be able to more or less understand my musings is the best of feelings. 😌

At the reflecting pools, a striking memorial to the people who lost their lives on September 11, I passed a group of women taking selfies. While they leaned against the bronze plates inscribed with the names of the victims and laughed out loud, I paralyzed, thinking if should say something to them. I didn’t. But I still wonder if I should have, and if so, what I could have said. #reflectingabsence

I came, I saw, I got swallowed–by New York, that is. Right now, Mr*Byen New York i USA*.G and I are in Reston, a sleepy little town not far from Washington D.C. We arrived Sunday late, and while Mr.G is here for work, I’ve been taking it easy, enjoying absolutely zero must-visits and letting our trip to the Big Apple sink in. 👑 Did you know, by the way, that you can climb all the way up to Lady Liberty’s crown? We were too late to book crown tickets, but I can imagine it must be quite a rad lookout.

I’ll take a “Bea Arthur” (vanilla ice cream, dulce de leche and crushed Nilla wafers) over a “Cronut” even on a cold winter day. This soft-serve exists on a different level of awesomeness. ✨🍦✨ And the [#Cronut](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/cronut/) (once-a-hype, still a hybrid between a donut and croissant with cream), which we had this morning for breakfast, was a disappointing, indelicate mess of sugar and made me wonder if Mr. Cronut himself ([@dominiqueansel](https://www.instagram.com/dominiqueansel/)) is perhaps chilling it in the Bahamas at the moment. 🍹🌴 The rest of today’s menu included hot dogs with kraut at Gray’s Papaya (🌭👌🏻), crab and pork soup dumplings at Joe’s Shanghai (😋) and lamb shepherd’s pie (😭👎🏻) and steak sandwich (🌟) with (dare I say it) subpar cocktails at (apparently) the world’s best cocktail bar, the Dead Rabbit ([@deadrabbitnyc](https://www.instagram.com/deadrabbitnyc/)). That is 3 successes and 2 losses. And, if we count the whiskies and beers at [@FrauncesTavern](https://www.instagram.com/FrauncesTavern/) (such a rad hideout), it all rounds up to 4-2. And that, that is not a bad for a first day in NYC.

I actually only ever wanted to visit 2 places in particular, that is India (2011 ✔️) and New York. And well, Mr.G and I happen to have arrived in the concrete jungle yesterday evening. 🙌🏻 We battled our way through “Le Jetlag” with a burger at [@ShakeShack](https://www.instagram.com/ShakeShack/) and a walky in our hotel’s hood around the Times Square. 📸 It was surreal, like sleepwalking in a Batman movie with Jay Z’s “Empire State of Mind” on replay. 🎙 “Let’s here it for New York, New York, #NewYork.”

Red brick roofs and cast iron window guards awoke the alleys of my childhood. Drinking fountains and pebbled pathways found their matching card in my memory and brought forth emotions of nostalgia that I didn’t even know I had. After 30 days of wandering and deliberate introspection, I found myself, on the last day of my travel spin-off, in a place that looked just like home. #spinoff9traveler

⭐️ Travel day 30/30.

👉🏻 Today’s post marks the end of the social media part of my travel spin-off. Check #spinoff9traveler for the other 29 travel stories and have a look at “[30 Days of Travel Stories and Lessons Learned on the Road](http://www.thespinoffproject.com/30-days-traveling/)” for the accompanying behind the scenes stories.

Through a labyrinth of narrow streets, I walked in the direction of the “Mezquita-Catedral” (Mosque-Cathedral) of Córdoba, “the jewel of the city”, a church turned mosque, the mosque turned cathedral/mosque, all the while being distracted by Córdoba’s pebbled patios and plazas and fairytale taverns that demanded pit stops and snapshots. 👸🏼🍸📸\
I arrived at the Mezquita-Catedral fortified by a glass of “fity”, a combination of “fino” (a bone-dry pale sherry) and “Pedro Ximénez” (an intensely sweet dark dessert sherry), set to be impressed by the 856 columns of which I had heard so much already. 🕌

And yet, as hypnotizing as the forest of columns and arches, and as dramatic as the presence of a cathedral smack in the middle of a mosque was to my eyes, I seemed far more interested in the stories and people who live beyond the walls of this architectural wonder. ✨#spinoff9traveler

I was in Córdoba, sitting in Bar Lucas, mapping out the rest of my day, while Rafael, the owner, prepared me one of his famous hotdogs. I was feeling unjustifiably stressed, having taken my self-inflicted challenge, to visit 3 cities in 72 hours, a little too serious. But as Rafael let me hoover in his kindness, my petty troubles dissolved. 🍺🌭

There seemed to be an eternity between the sound of my alarm and Rafael’s “Buenos días”. My memory filled with sights that I wouldn’t remember. And the only travel stories worth keeping, apparently ordinary. Anecdotes about timeless dwellings in local bars and early-morning drives amidst sleepy faces on their way to the daily grind. 🚗

I could’ve stayed forever in Bar Lucas, but more historical monuments demanded to be seen and forgotten. With 3 chocolate candies in my hand (at the insistence of Rafael), I left Bar Lucas to its rightful regulars and mournfully closed yet another sacred portal to everyday local life.✨🚪✨ #spinoff9traveler

Here’s a drink you ought to try over the weekend: the “tintón”—a boozed-up version of the highly popular Spanish drink, “tinto de verano” (summer wine). The later is made up of 1 part of (young) red wine and 1 part of “La Casera” (carbonated lemonade) while the tintón also includes a shot of vermouth and a shot of gin. 🍸

I made the mighty tintón for my friends when I came back from Spain (my kind of souvenir), and they all loved it. I used one bottle of young Rioja wine (750ml or 25 ounces), an equal amount of 7-Up Zero (Sprite is fine too), 100ml or 3 ounces of vermouth ([@Martini_Official](https://www.instagram.com/Martini_Official/) Bianco will do) and 100ml of gin ([@BombaySapphireOfficial](https://www.instagram.com/BombaySapphireOfficial/) is good). I also threw in 4 handfuls of ice cubes (be generous, the Spaniards are) and added 2 sliced up limes. 🙌🏻

I discovered this fabulous mixed goodness in Seville’s award-winning, gourmet tapas bar “Ovejas Negras” (Black Sheep, [@ovejasnegrastapas](https://www.instagram.com/ovejasnegrastapas/)), where besides getting glazed over a tintón or two, you also must try the “carrillada con puré de patatas y ajos asados” (slow-cooked pork cheeks with mashed potatoes and roasted garlic). #samesamebutboozier

In Spain, every square, corner or alley seems to be occupied by a charming terrace. A quick Google search reveals that my observation can’t be far from the truth. Apparently, there are 350.000 bars in the country, that is one for every 132 of its’ 47.2 million inhabitants. 😁🍷#thegoodlife

The Cortadillo de Cabello de Ángel (“slice of angel’s hair”) is my kind of sweet. It’s made with two layers of lemon and cinnamon flavored cake and a jam-like pumpkin filling. The type of pumpkin that is used to make the jam is called “fig-leaf guard” or “cidra”, and when cooked, the flesh of the fruit becomes stringy and looks just like spaghetti, or if you prefer, like angel’s hair. 😇 #loveatfirstbite

The Metropol Parasol, which is better known as “Setas de Sevilla” (Seville’s mushrooms), is a wooden structure of 150 meters by 80 meters (490 ft by 230 ft) that hoovers 26 meters (85 ft) above the Encarnación square. 🍄 The elevated plaza is a dreamlike hangout, perfect for moments of quiet reflection or alfresco meet-ups with friends. Sights of the later and places like Seville, where the weather is agreeable most of the year and life is lived outside, always make me long for a hometown with more sunshine. ☀️

A Spanish breakfast classic: tostada con aceite y tomate (toasted bread with fresh tomato pulp, olive oil and a pinch of salt) y un café con leche (coffee with milk). 🍞🍅☕️

I remember eating this morning meal with a big smug smile on my face, proud for being able to order in Spanish (off the menu). And especially so, because after spending a few days with Mr.G’s parents, I had started doubting my Spanish skills again. 🤔

The goldies are the main reason why I started learning Spanish in the first place and the only Spaniards, or so it sometimes seems, who I’m still unable to understand. But as frustrating as that is, I’m not about to give up yet. In fact, I’m starting over. And this time, I’ll be following the (super complicated—or is that just me?) *Fluent Forever* language learning guide by Gabriel Wyner. Brace yourself little parents-in-law, I’m coming for ya. ☄

By the way, speaking of breakfast way back up there 👆🏼, has any of you been experimenting with bulletproof coffee or tea? That is, adding grass-fed butter and coconut oil to your hot beverage of choice?

Overly excited by the last tapas dish of the evening (slow-cooked pork cheeks with mashed potatoes and roasted garlic) and the discovery of a new drink of choice (a “tintón”: red wine, gin, vermouth and soda pop), I bounced from alley to alley until an announcement caught my eye: “EXTRA FLAMENCO SHOW TONIGHT!”, it read. 💃🏻

I was in the south of Spain, giving 24-hour city trips the benefit of the doubt and challenging myself to travel faster than I normally do. In three days I was to cover Seville, Córdoba, and Granada and with those whirlwind visits to complete my 30-day travel spin-off. ✈️⛵️🚍

To my own surprise, and by the look of my now-checked off list of 25 points of interest, I was off to a good start. In one day of non-stop sight hunting madness, I managed, more than less, to grasp Seville’s essence. Re-opening my itinerary to add a last-minute flamenco show seemed redundant.

The challenge taker in me though disagreed. And thus, too tired to argue with my demanding ego, I walked over to the ticket counter, but only to find myself, as if I had spun a revolving door full circle, back on the street again. The show was sold out. And I relieved for it had already been a day of abundance. 🗺🍷

I continued on the last stretch of my route, past Seville’s monster, the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the See, contemplating if I should, at last, give its’ 2-football-fields-size structure the attention it demands, when all of sudden I heard distant cries. 🎙

There they were, three fearless beings with their darks sounds and clasps of hands, stealing the cathedral’s nocturnal limelight in the corner of my eye. It was an impromptu flamenco street performance, the “cherry on top” which would even strike Hermes, the God of travel, with envy. #spinoff9traveler

This cosmopolitan is spot-on and so is the venue and the incredibly kind gentlebarmen. The rockstars of the night though, are without doubt the Gimlet (gin and lime) and Diego (vodka, advocaat, apricot brandy, lime).
