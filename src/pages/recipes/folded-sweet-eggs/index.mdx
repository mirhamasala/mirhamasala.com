G and I tried this recipe[^1] for the first time in Ericeira, Portugal. We liked it so much that we immediately made it again. It reminds me of the Japanese rolled omelet, called _tamagoyaki_, often served over sushi rice. Best with a glass of cold, raw milk.

## Ingredients

- 4 pastured eggs
- 2 tablespoons Greek yogurt (10% fat)
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil

## Method[^2]

1. Separate egg whites and yolks into two bowls
2. Beat egg whites to firmish peaks
3. Beat yolks with yogurt and honey
4. Pour the yolk mixture into the whites and fold through until combined
5. Heat coconut oil in a 20cm frying pan over medium heat and make sure to coat the edges of the pan too
6. Pour the mix into the pan
7. Once the eggs start to set, push the edges to the center and repeat until there's not much raw egg left to move
8. Remove the pan from the heat once most of the raw egg has set and let the folded sweet eggs cool down on a plate

[^2]: For a sweet omelet version, follow the first six steps above. Then, for step 7: Pour the mix into the pan and cook until the bottom is golden. 8. Take the pan off the heat and put it under the oven grill until the top is bronzed too. 9. Remove the pan from the grill and let the sweet omelet cool down on a plate.
