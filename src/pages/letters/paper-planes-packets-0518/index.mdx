Hi, All!

**How have you been?**

April was quite the month for me, as I got my first gig as a web developer. I’m working freelance for a startup called Fastgardener in London.

The first week on the job, I was scared, overwhelmed, and beyond happiness, all at the same time. I think I’m still all of that, but just to a slightly lesser extent.

One day, I know I’ll look back at this time in my life, and remember it as the most fun period in my career as a web developer.

To remind myself of this when I’m struggling, I’ve started keeping note of my milestones as a newly hatched developer.

Here are a few entries:

- I get a message saying “..perhaps you could start tomorrow?”
- I create my first app from scratch without any help
- I solve my first JavaScript challenge for FastGardener
- I get my first salary as a web developer (and invite my parents and Mr. G for dinner)

As for writing, I’ve started working on a post about the [introduction my friends were most excited about](/posts/favorite-things-2017#korean-skincare) in 2017: the 10-step Korean skincare routine.

It’ll include all the products I use and plenty of advice on how to get your own routine on. Until it’s finished, however, here are a few things I’m currently enjoying.

## Current Favorites

### Audiobook I’m Listening

🎧 [48 Laws of Power](http://a.co/311TT0i) by Robert Greene\
I imagined this to be quite a dry listen, but less is true. 48 Laws of Power brims with tales and anecdotes about historical figures, like Cleopatra and Napoleon, and about how they rose and fell from power, and dealt with love, money, friendship, rivalry, and the cards they held. The stories are amusing and well-narrated, and are the reason why I like this book; the laws spell trouble.

### Book I’m Reading

📖 [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](http://a.co/fAgKFv5) by Yuval Noah Harari\
Proves with every page that I know very little about my kind. I’m learning a lot. And the book is funny too. I wish I could remember all the author’s arguments for those tiring “it’s how the cavemen lived” discussions.

_Hat tip to Arjen Calter for recommending it to me._

### Experiment I’m Loving

👩🏻‍🔬 A habit that I have is that whenever I fall below my ideal weight, I start eating more than usual. It’s a [habit that I’ve wanted to change](/posts/read-100-books/#power-of-habit) but found hard to do so. A few weeks ago though, I started writing down what I eat. And it’s been quite helpful. Knowing that I’ll have to document everything I chow down, makes me stop and consider if I want to put it in my mouth in the first place. I’m also more conscious about the amounts of food I consume and have been able to cut down on snacking and stick to eating three times a day. And, when I do have roasted garlic cashews, I now have ten, not a bag.

### Recipe I’m Making Around the Clock

🥄 Speaking of eating habits, these days I have only one proper meal a day. During the week I’ll usually have a smoothie for breakfast, go out for lunch, and then have another smoothie or something light (like an omelet with mushrooms) for dinner. On the weekends, I’m likely to switch it up and go out for supper.

I love this eating routine because it allows me to have one sky-high-calorie dish (of which there are plenty in Singapore) every day if I desire, while still being able to keep my weight in check. Furthermore, eating less in general, and especially for dinner, is making me feel really good.

🍠 My current favorite smoothie is [The Secret Ingredient Chocolate Smoothie](http://www.runningwithspoons.com/2015/02/25/secret-ingredient-chocolate-smoothie/). I always pop in the almond butter, but I do leave out the banana and dates. It’s plenty indulgent without those two for me.

### Quote I’m Pondering

> If you get tired learn to rest, not to quit. –Banksy

That’s it, all! Do let me know which of these favorites you loved and if there’s anything else you’d like me to write about.

Much lion love,\
