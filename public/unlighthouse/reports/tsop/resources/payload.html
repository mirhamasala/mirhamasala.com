<h2 id="note-taking">Note-taking</h2>
<p><strong>· <a href="https://www.simplenote.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simplenote</a></strong> – Notes application<br/>
<!-- -->Whenever I want to take a quick note, I use Simplenote. I also keep my list of weekly working priorities on here, which helps me stay away from my far more intimidating “complete to-do list.” I don’t use Simplenote to store any notes; the scribbles on here either get deleted or copied to OneNote.</p>
<p><strong>· <a href="https://www.onenote.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OneNote</a></strong> – Digital notebook <br/>
<!-- -->OneNote is my go-to notebook. I keep everything in here from working goals and project ideas to book highlights and travel itineraries. It’s the most important application I have, and quite a little monster by now.</p>

<p><strong>· <a href="http://www.apple.com/lae/pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pages</a></strong> – Word processor<br/>
<!-- -->I edit my first drafts (handwritten) in Pages, before copying and pasting the final versions to WordPress. Link-heavy articles like this one, however, I prefer to write and edit directly in WordPress.</p>
<p><strong>· <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RG1OFW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New American Roget’s College Thesaurus in Dictionary Form</a></strong> – Dictionary<br/>
<!-- -->Roget is my best writing friend. I use him all the time to find the words that I can’t come up with.</p>
<p><strong>· <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SEGJ5S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition</a></strong> – Synonym dictionary<br/>
<!-- -->I regularly mix up the meaning of English words, so using a dictionary when I’m writing is indispensable. The Kindle edition works great with the Kindle search function and makes looking up words simple and quick. Plus, the internal links make it easy to jump from one definition to another.</p>
<p><strong>· <a href="https://grammarly.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=209&amp;aff_id=12957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grammarly</a></strong> (premium plan) – Grammar checking tool<br/>
<!-- -->I use Grammarly to check all my writing, which includes, my blog and social media posts, but also, for example, my e-mails. Grammarly always finds a few spelling, grammar or punctuation mistakes that I missed or didn’t even recognize as such.</p>
<p><strong>· <a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropbox</a></strong> – Cloud storage<br/>
<!-- -->I never store my drafts locally on my laptop. Instead, I keep them on Dropbox. Once I have a final draft though, I’ll move it from Dropbox, and back it up to my Amazon Drive and an external hard disk.</p>

<!-- -->Working in Photoshop with a pen tablet feels so much more natural than working with a mouse. It took me a couple of days to get used to it, but now I can’t imagine editing images in any other way. Even when I only have a couple of pictures to do, I’ll take out the tablet.</p>
<p><em>I found out about the Wacom tablet from Manfred Werner in his Udemy course &quot;The Platform’s Biggest &amp; Most Popular Photoshop Course&quot; (discontinued).</em></p>
<p><strong>· <a href="https://www.camerabits.com/tour-v5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photo Mechanic 5</a></strong> – Media browser<br/>
<!-- -->Photo Mechanic 5 is my newest favorite application. It makes importing and organizing a batch of photos a breeze. I’ve been using it for all my recent photography works, but also to go through a crazy amount of old holiday photos.</p>
<p><em>Recommended to me by my dear friend and photographer <a href="http://www.silviafalcomer.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silvia Falcomer</a>.</em></p>

<!-- -->With Canva you can design anything from a social media post to a magazine cover and have the result looking pro in no time. I’ve used it to add text to my images (see photo below and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/thespinoffproject/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#thespinoffproject</a>), and even though I’m now a lot more familiar with Photoshop than I used to be, I would still pick Canva over Photoshop for this kind of design work.</p>

<!-- -->I use both an external drive and Amazon Drive to store and back up all my images (and all other files). That’s two backups of the same content in two different places. I also have the <a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Drive mobile app</a> installed on my phone, which gives me access to all my photos wherever I am.</p>

<!-- -->Before Mosaico, I used a complicated workaround to check whether or not my “next planned Instagram post” would fit my feed. I looked ages for an app like this one and at some point even considered hiring someone to make it for me.</p>

<p><strong>· QuickTime</strong> – Media player by Apple<br/>
<!-- -->When I want to upload a screen recording of me browsing my blog (usually to announce a new blog post on Instagram stories), instead of using my phone’s camera to film my computer’s screen, I use QuickTime to make a proper screen recording.</p>

<p>I also use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/kcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kindle App and Kindle for Mac</a>, which means I have access to all my collections on both my iPhone (for easy access to city guides and cookbooks) and laptop (for looking up something quick and using the dictionary and thesaurus) too.

I have it installed on my phone, laptop, and home sound system (see next resource). Spotify, by the way, is also fantastic for discovering new music (one of my all-time favorite past times).

<!-- -->If I were to do my first spin-off–<a href="/tsop/posts/polyglot-month">Be a Polyglot</a>–over, <em>Fluent Forever</em> would no doubt be the only guide that I would use to learn Spanish. Admittedly, Wyner’s method is crazy comprehensive, and I wouldn’t be surprised if you don’t even get through the book. Then again, if you’ve decided on learning a new language, which takes a lot of time anyway, you might as well invest some of it in Fluent Forever and find out how to do it best.</p>
<p><strong>· <a href="http://ankisrs.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anki</a></strong> – Flashcard program<br/>
<!-- -->I use Anki to learn Spanish the Fluent Forever way, that is, with flashcards. I make flashcards for every word, verb conjugation (using <a href="http://www.spanishdict.com/conjugate/amar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SpanishDict’s verb declaration charts</a>), or grammar construction (following <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471134465" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Practical Spanish Grammar: A Self-Teaching Guide</a>) that I can’t seem to remember, and then let Anki do its spaced repetition magic. I use both desktop and mobile applications.</p>
<p>On a sidenote, Anki isn’t a very user-intuitive app, so count on having to dedicate a weekend to figure it out. If you’re going to be following the Fluent Forever language learning methods, then have a look at Wyner’s article <a href="https://fluent-forever.com/chapter2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to use Anki</a>. I also recommend going through <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anki’s own user manual</a>. I know it’s quite a bit of work, but you only have to do it once, and compared to having to make actual flashcards (or worse, learning the wrong way), it’s fine.</p>

<!-- -->Using a meditation app helped me make meditation a habit. And being able to track how often I meditate, makes me do it more often. At the moment, I’m using the Calm app. I like the “breathe feature” and the nature scenes with background sounds. Besides doing a meditation (preferably) every morning, I’ll also hit the breathe button whenever I feel anxious throughout the day and follow it for a minute or two or until I calm down.</p>

<p>Never let the things you want make you forget the things you have –unknown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keeping a gratitude journal reminds me of the things I have and the moments and people I treasure. I don’t use it every day (anymore), but I’ll write at least a couple of mornings a week, usually straight after meditation. Once in a while, I also like to scroll through my feed and read past entries. I use the <a href="http://app.fiveminutejournal.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Five Minute Journal app</a> instead of the paper version because, among other things, I travel a lot and don’t like to own too many physical objects. And although I love the option of being able to add photos with the app, I would nevertheless recommend getting <a href="https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the paper Five Minute Journal</a>. When it comes to journaling, I do believe that the act of writing beats the act of typing.</p>

After following the 12-week program to the letter, I still keep working with the exercises in the book to strengthen my creative esteem. I also continue to plan artist dates with myself and have stuck to journaling for 15 minutes every morning, except for one day in the weekend, when I’ll journal the full six pages per the program. Following “The Artist’s Way” is quite an investment in time, but if I could recommend only one resource from this page, <em>The Artist’s Way</em> would be it.</p>

The quotes lighten my mood whenever I’m taking my work (or myself) too seriously. Furthermore, I’ve noticed that over time, these inspirations have weaved themselves into my everyday thought patterns. And when my self-doubt rises, they tend to come to my defense in the form of encouraging echoes. Do note that the collections change and the styles can be hit-or-miss.</p>

I don’t follow the slow-carb diet continuously, but I do stick to its rules to keep my weight in check. All this comes down to is that I’m careful not to eat too many carbs and dairy products. Still, whenever my jeans get a tad too tight, I’ll go full-on slow-carb for 2-3 days or for as long as it takes to loosen them.</p>

<!-- -->Inspired by Sarah Wilson’s I Quit Sugar 8-Week Program, I’ve been cutting down on sugar since 2014. Although I’ve followed the program more than once, I now just follow Wilson’s nutrition principles. I’ll go without sugar (which includes honey, cane sugar, coconut nectar and fructose-heavy fruits) for anywhere from four to ten weeks. During these no-sugar streaks, I’ll only have some berries, a few blocks of 90%+ chocolate and perhaps a treat made with stevia or rice malt syrup. When I break my streaks, I do so pre-planned and intentionally. These breaks last about one ice cream affair, after which I go straight back to cutting sugar out of my diet again.</p>

<!-- -->After having completed the full 12-week training plan, I now follow a lighter, self-customized, Kayla workout routine. It consists of a 5K jog, HIIT run, and two full-body resistance workouts per week (in contrast to the original plan which includes another run and resistance exercise and an optional challenge). The resistance workouts are intense and leave me with muscle pain for days. However, they only take 28 minutes to complete, and furthermore, make my body very strong. Even though I can’t go surfing, kite or snowboarding most of the year, I’ve noticed that when I do, my body has no problem handling the intensity of the physical effort that these sports require.</p>

Being able to track my runs and progress with the app played a pivotal role in making running a habit. While there was a time that I didn’t run because I thought I was bad at it, not only can’t I now even grasp the ridiculousness of that assumption, but I also can’t imagine not running. Running makes me feel strong, clears my head and helps me to relieve stress. Also, when traveling, going for a morning run is one of my favorite ways to get to know a place.</p>

<!-- -->Part of my pre-travel research includes creating a custom travel map with Google My Maps. Once on unfamiliar terrain, I can then pull up my map on my phone with the Google Maps app, which neatly layers my custom location marks over the standard Google map, and cruise around like Columbus couldn’t even imagine in his wildest navigation dreams.</p>
<p>I like to add different categories to my maps, like “sights” and “food &amp; drink,” and to use the many available icons and colors to differentiate between the location marks within those categories. For example, within “food &amp; drink,” I will mark pubs with a beer emoji while cocktail bars get a martini glass stamp.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I also like to keep a map of my favorite spots and other places that I wish to visit in my current hometown <a href="http://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mirhaxsingapore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singapore</a>. It’s quite handy for when I’m out of dinner ideas, or I find myself hangry in some unknown part of town. And, best of all, is that I can share a link to this map with visiting friends and family.</p>
