Hi, All!

**I hope you’re safe and healthy.** 🍃

Not long ago, I ordered a flower press. It was a quirky decision. [Something I saw and liked](https://framedflorals.com/). Something I thought would contribute to [play](/letters/paper-planes-packets-0820/).

But then I messed up and told people about it—people who demanded results.

That’s how, when the gadget arrived, instead of enjoying the discovery, I was now concerned with how the pressed flowers would turn out.

When the results didn’t overwhelmingly look like something sharable, _instagramable_, the whole flower press put me in a bad mood. Disappointed, I set it aside. Joy killed before it even had a chance to bud.

After a few days, I realized what I had done and resolved to take my flower press less seriously, as one should take flower presses.

Next time, I’ll make sure to protect my play, keep my silly projects secret. So they can remain goofy, and I can stay goofy–until I don’t mind.

## Words

2020 was _fill-in-the-blank_, and although I [wrote about both my ups and downs plenty](/letters/#2020), here’s a writeup of only good things, my annual list of [Favorite Things](/posts/favorite-things-2020/)–and still my favorite post of its kind.
