Curious to know what my life as an entrepreneur would be like, I set out to start my own business, immersing myself, day in, and day out, in entrepreneurship. These are my stories and experiences from my month as an entrepreneur told through a series of questions.

## 1. Why did you want to be an entrepreneur for a month?

After my graduation, it became obvious that the job market, in its disastrous current economic situation, hadn’t been waiting for me at all.

My MA degree in European Studies wasn’t opening any magic doors and it didn’t look like it was going to get me a challenging and well-paid job any time soon.

My degree, or more accurately, my parent’s network, did get me an internship at an embassy.

My time there though, made me realize that even if I was to get the best possible job in my field *now*, I would still be working in an environment that I don’t like, doing things I don’t like doing.

Moreover, during my studies, I had the chance to work for many different companies. In the end, no matter what the job was, I disliked all of them because of _the depressing office environment_.

These experiences amounted to something I already knew in my heart: I wanted to work for myself.

## 2. What kind of business did you set up?

Mr. G and I started a company called GM Media Projects. We experimented with Internet marketing, trying everything from AdSense and affiliate networking to mobile advertising and selling a niche product.

In the meantime, I also started setting up my long-term projects: this blog and the online city guide [The Girl With The Blueprint](http://www.thegirlwiththeblueprint.com).

## 3. What was it like to be an entrepreneur every day for a month?

It was exciting. I was bursting with ideas and was positive that the projects would be an instant hit. I was already planning my retirement and the one of my family and friends, too.

That optimism and unconditional belief in oneself and one’s projects is priceless.

It was amusing to see my friend Arjen Calter go down the same path when I was [helping him to set up his first projects](/tsop/posts/philanthropist-month/).

By that time, I was already working more than half a year for myself and the hardships of being an entrepreneur had well set in.

Seeing Arjen in his first month was like seeing myself during my beginning. It made me long for that beautifully naive beginner's enthusiasm, wishing it could have stuck forever.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t. In one way or another, when you don’t meet your expectations (and there are many to meet when you work for yourself), it affects you. I am sure Arjen would say the same now.

## 4. If you could do this month over, what would you do differently?

Nothing.

When you start working for yourself, you need that absolute belief in yourself and your projects. The longer you can hold on to that confidence, the easier the battle.

## 5. What lessons did you take away from this month?

**Make mistakes and make them fast.**

When you start your own business, there’s so much coming at you that the only way to come out of it alive is by making a lot of mistakes.

Mistakes–not carefully calculated decisions–bring you closer to what you want.

**Don’t ask for everyone’s opinion.**

Only talk about your projects with people who understand what you’re doing.

It’s tempting to tell everyone about your ideas; however, most people aren’t able to share your enthusiasm because they simply don’t know what you’re talking about.

Ignorance often results in negative feedback which will knock out your confidence.

Furthermore, you’ll have to deal with being your own worst critic soon enough.

Ride your high as long as you can–there’ll be plenty of time to doubt yourself.

## 6. What do you like best about being an entrepreneur?

The best thing about being an entrepreneur (and the worst at times) is that I get to make the decisions.

Being an entrepreneur has made me fully responsible for my life.

Every day, I determine what needs to be done, and thus, what my life looks like and what I live for.
