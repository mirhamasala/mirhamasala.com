Hi, All!

**How are you?** 🌌

These weeks, I end my coding days with reluctance. When I do peel myself away from the keyboard, it’s mostly because I know that without rest, there’ll be no code.

Periods like these have been a common occurrence ever since I learned to code. But I was hesitant to celebrate them, lest I curse myself, and stop liking the work. Part of me expected that the obsession wouldn’t persist. After all, not many lasted before.

I still find it hard to believe that I found it. And yet, with _it_, I certainly don’t mean _my passion_.

With _it_, I mean a sort of happy cloud that hovers longer than ever before above the darkest question of all, [What should I do with my life?](/letters/paper-planes-packets-0319/)

With _it_, I also mean the relief that came with discovering that _it_ doesn’t have to be one thing.

I’m okay with coding being my job.

But I would be less so without my writing days.

Still, writing all day and every day makes me cry.

It’s the two that give me peace.

Together they work and make everything better.

For now, at least.

**Recommended reading:** [Big Magic](/tsop/posts/read-business-books#20-big-magic) by Elizabeth Gilbert and [So Good They Can’t Ignore You](/posts/read-100-books#56-so-good-they-cant-ignore-you) by Cal Newport. Both of these books have shaped my thinking on the subject of work and passion. When the darkest question of all gets hold of me, I try to remember to separate these catch-all phrases into job, hobby, career, and vocation. I have both books to thank for making me saner on this subject.

## Words

Last month, I got my latest lab results. They had seemed to be taking longer to arrive this time. The wait made me nervous, and so I let days pass until I dared to check with the doctor’s office.

Once I dialled, the receptionist told me that the results had been in for a while. She had tried calling me. I asked if I needed to see the doctor. She told me I didn’t.

I figured this either meant that someone had made a mistake, or that there were no abnormalities to discuss. And there it was, the paper in my hand confirmed, “Normal. No negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy.” All gone.

With this news, I felt more comfortable to expand the post [Everything I Know About Fasting and Going Keto](/posts/fasting-keto/), which I started last year.

Besides the intro on how I found out I had CIN 3 and how I used fasting and the ketogenic diet to purge precancerous cells, I’ve now also added some advice, a list of foods and supplements I use(d), and answers to a few questions I received.

## Quote That’s Been On My Mind

> You can measure your worth by your dedication to your path, not by your successes or failures. –Elizabeth Gilbert, [Big Magic](/tsop/posts/read-business-books#20-big-magic)
