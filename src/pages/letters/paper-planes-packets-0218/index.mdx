Hi, All!

**How are you?**

I’m about to enter into the third week of my coding bootcamp, and I’m feeling rough.

The first two weeks of coding were tough. And the experience hit me hard.

My emotions are all over the place, and I can’t seem to figure out why.

My best guess is that I badly want to understand everything, and when I don’t, it’s like my chances of becoming a developer are slipping away right in front of me.

But I can’t keep up like this. I have to calm down. Trust myself.

Whatever difficult challenge you find yourself in at this moment, I invite you to do the same: *trust yourself*.

## Decisions, Not Goals · The Tally

In my [last letter](/letters/paper-planes-packets-0118/), I told you that I wouldn’t be setting goals for 2018, but instead, making decisions. So far, this idea has been working out well.

I haven’t had any sugar, except for that “limoncello on the house,” which I gulped down unintentionally.

I haven’t bought anything (not that book that was priced down nor those two apps that I was convinced I couldn’t live without nor that backless summer dress).

And I’m still working on the no-complaint challenge. Day one it is, again.

## And More for 2018

There are two more decisions I made that I didn’t tell you about last time.

1.  Don’t chase people 🙋🏻‍♀️
2.  Only drink alcohol every other weekend 🍸

This year, I’m also paying less attention to the people who seem indifferent about having me in their life. And I’m breaking the “TGIF” habit. I can recommend both.

## Words

I have two posts for you this month:

- [Read 100 Business Books](/posts/read-100-books) 🔖
- [Not My Kind of Pie](/posts/resilience-pie/) 💪🏻🥧

I updated my bucket list challenge [Read 100 Business Books](/posts/read-100-books) with five finished reads. Here’s an idea I adored and included from *The 4-Hour Workweek*: “Instead of taking time off for extended travel, relocate to a place of choice for a few months and work remotely.”

The post [Not My Kind of Pie](/posts/resilience-pie/) is about resilience and comes with “a drawing of my resilience.” Here’s how it starts:

> The exercise read: “Draw a pie chart of your resilience.”\
> In retrospect, I’m thinking; maybe I misunderstood it. Perhaps I didn’t need to go that far. But I had a hard time starting at “resilience,” so I went the other way around, and dove into my memories, looking for the hardships of my past.
